Banee Mehra,Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University For Women -[IGDTUW],"BBA, General",6.0,The college curriculum is great but comes with a lot of cons too,"I got admission to the college in the spot round, I was the happiest because IGDTUW is one of the top universities, and it actually is. As far as the curriculum is concerned it is pretty good. The college has a well-groomed course curriculum, but the faculty isn't good, teachers simply read the ppts and send over the notes on WhatsApp. The class timings are soo hectic that it just feels like 9 to 5 office hours. I would say it is a good college in terms of the curriculum but in the end, it's us as students who have to do everything on our own, even if it's the placement opportunities. The college won't matter at a point in time it's you that matters. I've been in this college for like 3 months, it didn't feel good. The college vibe is something you'll miss here, because of the extra hectic schedule. The teaching method of the teachers is unsatisfactory, although all of them are well qualified they don't know how to teach. Students just come for attendance here.
Mid sem happened a bit too early"
