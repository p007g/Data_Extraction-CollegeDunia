Jay Aditya,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",7.0,"Lyf in DTU, also being Hosteler","I have chosen this course as I am interested in Mechanics since childhood. The faculty is okayish not so great as well as you won't be studying in the classroom as you have been studying in school. Some of the faculty are great no doubt. Haha, student ratio? Why? Well, here we have like 70 boys and 3 Girls on average. If you want a better ratio, choose NITs. Term exams were on time but due to the delay in admissions, our semesters have been shortened which is why we are facing problems in completing the syllabus on time."

And you have some much free time for co-curricular activities and freelancing. The faculty is very awesome and experienced here. The professors are very helpful and kind. All faculty members are very highly qualified. I didn't know the exact qualification but all of them are PhD holders aur extra than that. So don't worry about the faculty and teaching. So our semester started late so we have early exams almost 1.5 months before entering college. That's why we have to study hard for the mid-semester examinations. But if you study well and give some extra time to your studies you will definitely score good marks in your exams. So don't worry about the examinations."

The faculty: student ratio is not so good as compared to collages like DTU and NITs and in every class there are about 70-80 students and there are many sections of a single branch like CSE has 4 sections including both shifts then comes AIML then AIDS then CST then IT in terms of only computer field. And this is not i liked and thought before coming here.
The faculties are some from NITs and some have done PhD and basically most of the faculties (75-80%)has 3 degrees as i saw written on their cabin. 

The exams are not very difficult to pass here as there is no strict attendence rule they say 70% but seniors told that 60% also works, and in first semester we had our midsem after 2 months and then end semsems in next 2 months but teachers say that due to covid you came late so your first year is running a bit fast than rest in order toequalize"
