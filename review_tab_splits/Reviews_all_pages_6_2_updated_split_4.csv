The future scope of this course is great as well.
The faculty: student ratio is 1:80 in the CSE Department for the UG course.

Nearly all the faculties are passouts from elite colleges such as IIT Madras, IISc Bangalore, IIT Kharagpur, etc., and hold Ph.D. degrees. Hence, they're more than qualified to shine their light of knowledge on us. The teaching methods followed vary from faculty to faculty. Some prefer teaching using presentations while some prefer the old-school method of teaching on board. Either way, they try their level best to deliver us the content we need, and make sure we understand every bit of it.
I haven't given a term exam as of yet, as our classes had begun on 28th November due to the COVID Pandemic. But we do have received a schedule for the exams, and our mid-semester exams are going to start mid-January, and end-semesters in March."

Ashwani Kumar Tiwari,Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology -[CSAUA&T],"MBA, Agribusiness",6.4/10,"MBA Agri business:Fee, Scope and Future Opportunity","I choose the course of agribusiness because like after BSc in agriculture you can go for MSc in agriculture or MBA in agribusiness. I don't want to prepare for Ph.D. in the government sector so there is a better scope of an MBA in the private sector rather than an MSc in agriculture.
Another reason for doing MBA is placement. The placement ratio of MBA students is better than m.sc students and salaries are also good. Another reason is in the private sector and MBA degree holders will get better promotions than average MSc degree holders.
On my campus, there are 46 students in MBA agribusiness and 7 to 80% of them will surely get a minimum package of 350000 and a maximum package of 8 lacs.
The guest faculty of MBA agribusiness is quite good. There are some teachers who are not as good as others but there is a 100% guarantee of course completion.
Semester exams are not quite easy or too difficult if you will focus a little bit on your studies you will easily get pass. Semester exams are delayed."
