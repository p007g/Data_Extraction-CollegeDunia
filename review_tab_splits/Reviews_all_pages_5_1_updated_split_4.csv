Faculty are also good 
The faculty-student ratio is the same
The teaching method is superb

Bagala Gowtham Narasimha,Vignana Bharathi Institute of Technology - [VBIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.5,Review on VBIT,"I have chosen the course electronic and communication engineering because I can improve my brief knowledge of hardware and software. I have chosen the course for the government job. So, I can move for private or government jobs easily. The faculty, they are good experience in teaching the core subjects of electronics and different communications. The way of teaching faculty is extraordinary. But it is difficult to pass the subjects. We have to focus on the mathematical term, theory, expression etc"
Rishabh Nahriya,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",7.5,College was fine,I am in the electrical engineering branch at Netaji Subhas university of technology. The faculty members or teachers are good but some subject teachers are very rude. I choose this course because I have an interest in the electrical and electronics field.
Shashwat kumar,United College of Engineering & Research - [UCER],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.0,Mera desh mera college,"According to me, the curriculum is good but it's a little bit longer to be covered in one semester. Although the faculty members are fully enthusiastic and are with the students. 
Faculty members are all gate qualified and many have already done PHD.
In the ECE department, there are 15 faculty members and over 50 students which I think is more than sufficient. 
Our curriculum is designed such that the students have to study thoroughly and so as the exams."
Varu Solanki,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence",6.0,Internship opportunities,"My course is computer science engineering and according to its placement I selected this course because I am interested too much in it main faculty and guest faculty both are there. Hod and top faculty are best in their qualification and also guest faculty are passed from IIT and have MTech and PhD. Course Fees: INR 210000 per year. Internship opportunities are available on campus but there is a thing for boys and girls both are different a girl can get internships easily but for a boy, it's too difficult to on campus you have to be petty good at coding and with a GPA of 9 +. So about the fee, I would like to say it's a bit costly as other govt colleges are much more cost-effective but this JAC Delhi college is not. college + hostel+mess for my course is 12-13 lakh for 4 years which is costly and for scholarships, there is one merit-based that is available for everyone."
SHAIK NAGUR VALI,Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College - [VRSEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.8,Siddartha Statement,"The Curriculum is good and based upon current trends in the market & all the faculty members are highly qualified has completed their master's & PhD in their selective fields.

Student (Anonymous),KLE Technological University,"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.2,The Elite,"I must say it is one of the best universities.
The reason to choose this course: E&C is one of the best branches because if you compare it with other branches some branches teach only about programming they don't have any hardware knowledge, and some branches teach only about hardware. But in e&c you will learn both programs as well as hardware.
In this college you will get one of the best faculties, best in the sense they too supportive and encourage you to do something great,
The faculty-student ratio may be for every 10 to 15 students one faculty is there.
Most of the faculties have the PhD degrees with a great experience.
After every 1 and a half months, there will be an exam i.e internals, there total of 2 internals and an end sem exam.
It is not too difficult to pass the exam but yes questions will be completely application based, but a student can pass easily."

SOHAN RAUL,Gandhi Institute for Technology - [GIFT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.0,"Must known facts before enrolling in GIFT, Bhubaneswar","Unlike other colleges, there are not any hidden charges. Fees hike is rare unless there is any inflation. Study cost is worth. Because what you get in your fees is completely worth it. 
You will find many scholarships like state and central government all scholarship is applicable to you. Including this, Industries like SAIL and some other releases their scholarship. You will get notified by the faculty members who are specially appointed to aware students about scholarship information. College claims that they will help you to get study loans but I recommend you to manage yourself for study loans if you need them.
Come to jobs, colleges provide campus joining where companies like TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, etc. recruit students. But my suggestion is, you always look for off-campus opportunities and don't worry about how to get to know about opportunities. You will automatically get to know if you have a strong friend zone."

In an online class, there is not much interest shown. The term exams take place every 45 days it is taken 2 times in a semester and other lab exams are also taken they are somewhat tough but easy to manage. 
But the semester-ending exams are a little bit hard sometimes how much we wrote correctly also they fail they simply keep a zero in it. Why this happens I don't know. 
Better to read daily and answer all questions correctly."
