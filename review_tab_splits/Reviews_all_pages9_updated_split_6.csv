You have on campus as well as off campus placement. Students had grabbed good placements in various private firms mostly banking with an average package of 4-6 LPA. 
Since I am a first year student. I don't know much about placement and Internships. But you will get more opportunities in this university than any other agricultural university in this state. And in the coming future, the demand will increase for agriculture graduates. Most students who don't take placements prepare for JRF and higher studies or prepare for PCS and various vacancies in both government and private firms providing good posts and salaries. There are many more options to explore than you know now. You will get to know many more options from your professors and seniors."

Faculty student ratio is good, there is enough faculty for a subject.
Exams were conducted regularly and proper care is taken for students who are lagging in a subject.
Faculty is quite good in teaching, I got more interested in the subjects of computer science with their quality teaching."
Anand Agrawal,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology - [MAIT],"B.Tech, Electrical And Electronics Engineering",7.6,Internships,"College is believed to conduct a lot of interesting fests and events to keep the environment and fun throughout the year, but since we are students of this online era, so we didn't get a chance to see this year.
As for the availability of books we have a Book Bank in the college library which provides us all the books that will be required throughout the course and that is given to us for basically free with just some security amount that is refundable. Classrooms and washrooms are clean. There are a lot of extracurricular activities like Music, Dance, Fashion Designing etc. but there are not many facilities for sports. There are a lot of societies in which the students can join based on their interests like Coding, Motorsports, drama, Singing or dancing."
Krishna Kishore Chowdhury,Government College of Engineering & Textile Technology - [GCETT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.2,GCETTB Review,"Since childhood, I had a passion to continue my higher studies in Computer Science and Software technologies, that's why I selected Computer Science and Engineering branch. In our college, there are 12 faculty members in the CSE department. Nearly 40 candidates can get into this college every year for the CSE branch. As a result faculty-student ratio is very good. The faculties here are highly qualified and they teach and everything clearly. They are also very friendly, anyone can ask their doubts and solve their queries. They teach everything from scratch and also take regular tests. Now about the exams, there are 4 internal exams (Continuous Assessment) and 2 semester exams in a year. There are also Practical Assessments. The difficulty level of these exams varies from moderate to tough. But I would say any hardworking student will definitely ace these exams with great marks."

Hemlata Joshi,ICFAI Business School - [IBS],,8.8,IBS : A Review,"The admissions for the MBA course is merit based. For the admission the candidates must have a valid CAT/GMAT/XAT score. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of this score, and then called in for a GD/PI. The final selection is based on the performance of the candidate in GD/PI. My reason for opting ICFAI was its high ranking. It has ranked 26 by NIRF and 8 for Private MBA by Outlook. The academics at the institution are in par with that offered at IIMs and NITs."

Akash,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.6,My Opinion on IIIT Pune,"One of the main reasons was that it was a central government college in Pune. If I had gone through more rounds, I would have gone to other colleges, but I needed a CSE so IåÊchose this college. Placements for B. Tech students are excellent, which is another reason to choose this college. In terms of drawbacks, we don't have a permanent campusåÊandåÊhostel, they areåÊstill under construction. Furthermore, COEP, one of the best colleges in Maharashtra, is mentoring the college, which is a plus. The admissions process is the same as that of any other reputable IITs or NITs. We must provide all Bonafede certificates as well as a few undertaking forms. Due to covid-19 restrictions the admission process is being conducted online. Admission Date will be announced by JoSAA and physical reporting is not required as of now."
ANUSHA KALLEPALLY,Sphoorthy Engineering College - [SPHN],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.8,My Experience at campus,"They will provide a good amount of knowledge to the students which flow along in a disciplined manner. They are experienced, faculty. They all will be supportive all the time, many practical sessions throughout the degree program which helps students to uplift their skills.

We have a sports day each year where various physical sports events are organized. Teachers and students part take in these events, The events are for two-three days.
We have a WhatsApp group for each class where teachers share important news and notes."
Student (Anonymous),Father Agnel Technical College,"Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",10.0,Best College for Diploma in Navi Mumbai,"I choose this curriculum because I loved the fundamentals of mechanical engineering. I really enjoyed the subjects that were involved in this course. The faculty in Agnel polytechnic are very experienced in teaching. There is about 20 student to one faculty ratios and they really helped us in our engineering studies. Most of the teachers are M-tech with 20+ years of teaching experience. While the majority are helpful and supportive there are one or two who are really not that supportive and I do not recommend them. Most of them use projectors to teach and also make good use of technology such as microphone speakers to improve teaching quality. The exams are held at pretty good time intervals. Just as with the school Formative assessment timings so catching up was not an issue. Since the faculty was great, the subjects were passed relatively easily and we had no problems in our time. Every 2 months there would be a 20 marks unit test followed by a semester exam. Pretty good experience"
Vijay Joshi,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.5,My review of IIIT Pune,"Campus life is good but certainly not great since the permanent campus is yet under construction.

Jyoti prasad,Dibrugarh University,"PG Certificate, Women’s Studies",8.0,My beautiful experience in college during my Ug course,"We have to pay around 1100 at the time of admission every semester.  And we have to pay extra college fees, practical fees, bus fees (if anyone wants bus facility because of the distance of college and home) and hostel fees(if any student takes admission in hostels). 
Out of the above mentioned, sometimes college fees hike 500after taking admission in another semester. 
We don't get any kind of scholarship but, the college offers some scholarships for those students who were interested in civil service. For this scholarship, students have to pass an entrance, after qualifying for the exam they got the scholarship for preparation for the civil service through some coaching institutions. 
Some of our seniors got the job in my college without giving an extra interview which is conducted for the appointment of new employees or new teachers. 
Financially weak students were unable to pay all the fee amount get some relaxation in the fee."
