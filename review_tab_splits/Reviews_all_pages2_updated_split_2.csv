Anjali sah,Patna Women's College - [PWC],"BCA {Hons.},",3.2,Life at PWC,I choose this course because I wasn't able to get into btech colleges. The faculty-student ratio is moderate. Qualifications of the teachers are good but some teachers aren't up to the mark. Exams are held in 4 months only despite its a 6-month course due to pandemic situations they are covering up fast as our year started late.
Kuruva Vamshi,Vardhaman College of Engineering - [VCE],"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",7.6,True View by Vardhamanian,"I chose this course because it was booming at the time I was about to join engineering and it is still booming. And also I was even interested in Artificial intelligence back then. The faculty-to-student ratio is about 1:8 with qualified faculty who completed their graduation from reputed colleges in India like IIT, nit, etc. But they don't have enough teaching experience which would be a problem for some students. And they even have 4-5 years of experience in the industry so they have pretty good knowledge. Exams will be conducted on time which is given at the beginning of the semester. I would say it is not that difficult to pass the exam if you listen to the class and directly attempt the exam. But if you want to score good marks then you need to study about 3-4 hours per day."
