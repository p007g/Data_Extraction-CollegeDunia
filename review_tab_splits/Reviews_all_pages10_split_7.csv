The faculty is highly qualified but the only problem is that most of them don't enjoy their job. So you will find average lectures for namesake but if you are proactive you will get a lot of opportunities to explore yourself. The college will even fund you if you work on competitive projects. Technical trainers have a lot of expertise in core technologies. Project associates will guide you and always motivate you to work on more projects. A year is divided into 2 semesters. Two mid exams are conducted in between the semester. Apart from that, you need to submit assignments from time to time. We have an incubation centre and an R&D cell which encourages new startups."

Saral Mittal,IIT Bombay - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITB],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",4.8,"Better than expected Experience, [But]lower than expected salaries","I always had a fascination(still have) for mechanical engineering. I feel Faculty:student ratio is appropriate, Professors are available any time students try to reach them, whether it is professional advice or academic advice. Faculties are very highly qualified, almost all the professors have a PhD from internationally reputed universities along with significant post-doc experience. For first year courses(common courses for every department), faculty:student ratio is very low. To overcome the issue Teaching Assistants(TA) are recruited which are either graduate student or senior UG student who had performed exceptionally well in that course. The TAs help the student in their course-related problems during weekly sessions. Overall, the learning experience is not so great for 1st year courses due to many factors- Large batch size during instruction, lack of clarity in instruction and performance-oriented atmosphere particularly intense during the 1st year. In the subsequent years the quality of teaching improves drastically as the students take up the courses in their respective departments. Curriculum and the course content is still a bit outdated, but recently the focus on practical training has improved greatly. The total marks distribution for the courses is distributed across quizzes, mid-term, end-term and course projects, schedule of which is decided by the instructor, mostly at the beginning of the instructions."

Term exam is very helpful in checking the knowledge what we get in the weeks, there is 4 5 test in one semsters and these are very helpful and beneficial in order to see the university exam. These exams help you to give the idea of the difficulty level of the university exam.

The faculties of this institute have a high qualification as most of them are IITians, well-renowned Scientists, Ph.D. ones, etc.
Allocations of the faculty members are well planned in this institute and the Teaching process of them is a bit quite friendly.
They treat students like their friends and classes are held in a very fun manner. Students tell that faculties are very good in terms of explaining the topics and clearing our doubts.
The exams are held continuously like mid-term and end-term examinations. Assignments are held every week for testing students' skills.
The level of exams is quite tougher which we are supposed to give. I myself found it harder to score full marks in exams."
Harshit,Sri Aurobindo College,,7.6,College review,"The campus life is really awesome. I mean you get to stay in-between nature and many shopping complexes around and very easy access to metro and bus stations. Food shops and cafes are all nearby. Our college has conducted many fests and events in the past many years. So our college's main fest/event name is MEHAK. That was literally the best event and there were so many students who had participated in it. All fests/events took place in the month of April. Talking about the college library. So it is really well maintained I must say. As such we do not face any unavailability or shortage of books. When it comes to amenities that we get to experience in our classrooms. So I would say those are on an average scale. But we do not have any issues with that. This means, we get to experience and use all the basic things in good condition. The infrastructure of our college is not that good as I was expecting when I entered the college for the first time. But, yes all infrastructure in DU is on an average scale"

Ashlesh,IIT Kanpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITK],"M.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",9.0,,This is the best part of all. You cannot expect a better campus than this. Other IITs also got a nice infrastructure but as they are between the metropolitan cities they lack the space to expand. But IITK is 15 kms from Kanpur City and they have ample amount of space available. The campus is a lush green with nice architectural buildings open and green spaces. A lot of peacocks can be seen here and there.

The professors here are highly qualified and the faculty teaching a particular class also changes often regularly there is no deficiency of professor anyhow. All the things are very professional here. The academic calendar was followed throughout and not even a single exam was postponed or preponed. The difficulty level of exams is also above average and if you didn't study throughout it is going to be tough for you to pass the exam."
Shalin Patel,L J College of Computer Applications,,7.1,Fantabulous  LJMCA,"Good Persepctive:- This is a very good college for thise students whose willingly want to do something in that life for that career they can choose this for that reason becuase it's a 5 years combined course and after compketion of this course you will get direct master degree. And as i said that it is a combined course so you have to complete 5 years study as per rules of combined course but now in case of our institute there are college give you permission to leave the college once after completion of your bachelor of 3 year if you want then and also you get the bachelor degree.Bad Perspective:- Second thing is now our LJ INSTITUTES are converted as a individual university as LJ UNIVERSITY 2 years ago so you can take the course and admission by LJ UNIVERSITY too. but there is a one problem is that institute established as a university recently so there are still some years left for LJ UNIVERSITY to get in the recommend list with all other trademark universities. so all the students must wait and keep patience for upcoming 4-5 years to take an advantage of LJ UNIVERSITY so till then you can took each course as particular and already established University like AICTE  APPROVED AND GTU or GU affiliated.Admission Process For IMCA in LJ MCA is Very Simple rather than other institute Here you can apply both via online mode and offline mode but i got admission via offline mode and in offline mode there are some prerequisites are required ws following:#students must have passed Higher secondary eduaction(12th science(A group,B group or AB group),commerce) with minimum 45%.#the criteria are student must have 45% by sum of all subjects.if students have higher than 45% they are able to get the direct admission in this course via direct offline mode."

I have participated once in Sports Meet for kho kho, though first 2 competitions we've won but lost in the 3rd round after all that matters the most that how'd you enjoyed what you are doing.

The student and professor Ratio is low as my Institute admits more students than others ITs. It is hard to find any teaching faculty having.
Qualification less than IIT level and they have good teaching idea and experience.
As per my experience in online mode, it is easy to pass due to stress free appearance but I am sure if the same difficulty level Question were in offline mode it becomes hectic but I think there is no difference b/w online or offline. In online mode, we are not getting the proper way of learning. And offline it was very interesting and easy to clear out concept.
Meanwhile difficulty level be high to get pass or success really needs hardwork."

Question 2 - 1 faculty is for 60-70 students in theory classes and 30 - 35 students on 1 faculty for lab classes.
Question 3 - Qualification of faculty is mostly Mtech with few experienced and senior teacher with the degree of PhD. The teaching method is presenting a ppt on the smart board mostly. 
Question 4 - Exams are very very frequently. In a semester there are two term exams and one final university exam at the end of the semester with an internal and an external viva. The class test can also be held in a month depending on the teacher's mood. A pre-university exam is also held just before the university exam.
