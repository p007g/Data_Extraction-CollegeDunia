Plus if you are going for the hostel you have to pay an extra of 1.02 per year which includes mess and non-ac rooms. And for ac room, you have to pay 1.32 lakh per year. And with all that money you will get just nothing. And if I talk about the infrastructure. Then, 
To be honest I don't like the infrastructure of this college. But if you are the one who takes the admission just by looking at the infrastructure of the college then you should go for ABES EC instead of ABESIT. Yes,  many students got confused between obesity and abesec as they look like one college if you see from a distance but the reality is they are not.

nachiket budheliya,L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Robotics and Automation",8.2,4 golden years at LDCE,"This course is my passion and I do follow my passion there is a very bright future for these types of courses like robotics and automation, artificial intelligence, and Machine learning.
Faculties are very passionate about their work. most of our faculties have done their doctorate (Ph.D.) at institutes like NITs and IITs.
Their teaching methods are very good and they will complete the whole syllabus till the exam."
Parth ghadiya,L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Civil Engineering",8.5,My college life,"As for the difficulty of the GUJCET or GujCAT, the level of difficulty can vary from year to year, and it's difficult to generalize. However, these exams are designed to test a candidate's knowledge, skills, and aptitude in specific subjects related to engineering, and they require rigorous preparation and practice to pass.
To prepare for these exams, it's important to start early and follow a structured study plan. You can refer to previous years' question papers, study materials, and online resources to get an idea of the exam pattern and level of difficulty. Additionally, joining coaching classes or taking guidance from experienced mentors can help you prepare better and improve your chances of passing these exams.

Overall, passing term exams and entrance exams like GujCAT requires consistent effort, dedication, and hard work. With the right approach and preparation, you can successfully pass these exams and secure admission to LD College of Engineering."
Anchal Patel,Vishwakarma Government Engineering College - [VGEC],"BE, Information Technology",5.4,Vishwakarma Gove Engineering Collage Review,"The course syllabus is quite old. As it comes under GTU you will face so many delays in examinations and in other things as well. 
Faculty here have a decent knowledge of subjects. Almost all of them have done M.tech. and some are pursuing phd degrees. Some of them are quite supportive and some are not. As it is a government college you have to study on your own. Very few faculty complete the syllabus.
Coming on examination you have to give a class test, mid-semester examination, and viva for internal assessment. And the final exam is taken by University.  You can pass the gtu exam easily but to get good marks you have to study hard. The level of paper os decent."
Abhijit haldar,Centurion University of Technology and Management - [CUTM],"Polytechnic, Mining Engineering",7.2,Best university i recommended,"Campus placements are typically organized by colleges and universities to help their graduating students find employment opportunities. During these placements, companies visit the campus and conduct interviews, group discussions, and other selection processes to identify suitable candidates for their job openings.

However, not all colleges and universities offer campus placements, and even among those that do, the number and quality of job opportunities can vary widely.

That's all you will probably enjoy from the college facilities considering there aren't any other major fest being organised in the college. 
I guess there are quite a good amount of books in the library but its size and rules-regulations are pretty based. Library hours are from 9 am to 5 pm which is college hours, which means you cant study in the library peacefully after that. As a first-year student, you won't be allowed in the library during college hours, and also you'll probably not get your library card just before your ClassTests leaving you no time to actually study.
They have air-conditioned small-sized classes which can accumulate 50-60 students but it gets clustered on days all students are present.
They have a cricket field on the college campus but you're not allowed to play on it on most weekdays since its leased to other colleges to practice. They have a football ground in their school near the college."

Rage Manoj Kumar,PVKK Institute of Technology - [PVKKIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.3,My honest opinion about Pvkk institute of technology,"Fee structure is simple you pay the same amount for four year, year-wise not semester-wise. There is no scholarships for management students or financial assistance. The fee collection department is pretty harsh you have to pay the fee on time without delay . Yeah the college needs money to run but you should consider the student situation and relax the deadlines.  If you don't pay the fee they don't collect semester exam fees and I saw many of my friends not able to attempt the exam because the college refused to take the exam fee. I think the fee structure is reasonable for their respectable courses."

* All faculty regardless of their qualification express some uniqueness in their teaching method. Through this students can understand concepts easily. 
* There were 2 semesters in each year and 2 midterm examinations for each semester. Somehow it was difficult to clear midterm exams because the faculty strictly focus on the concepts which we have written in the answer sheets.

The present ratio is somewhere around 1:60
Most of the students usually don't attend the classes so, it's really not that big of an issue.
Most of the teachers are decently qualified with masters in various domains and some possess Ph.D. too. However, I do no really find their teaching to be inspiring. They seem more like monotonous renditions. I hope that they taught with more interest and evoked curiosity with their speech. Most of our classes are often canceled. It leads to a lack of interest and seriousness in education.
The exams were fairly easy to navigate as the pattern remains the same and students can easily gauge the repetitions through various sources easily available. A week of serious preparation before the commencement of exams can easily guarantee a student a decent CGPA."

Phani teja,Kakatiya Institute of Technology & Science - [KITSW],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,KITSW-A GOOD CHOICE,"This College collects a fair amount of fees from students for the quality education that they provide. They collect it on a yearly basis which is around 1,40,000 and another fee which includes the library and infrastructure which costs around 10,000. In this generation i would this is a fair few structures. People who have merit scores, i.e. having EAMCET rank below 10,000 have an exemption from fees by the state government, they only need to pay other fees of 10,000 per year. People with BC reservations get a fee reimbursement of 35,000 whose rank is above 10,000. One can also avail of Student loans or education loans to pay the fee. After all 4 years of my study, I could place myself in a job with a 9 LPA package. Considering this I would say it's a fair course vs affordability."

We have two midterm exams and a final exam; if you attend all of the classes, the exam will be simple for you; if not, it will be challenging, in my opinion. If you start studying a month before the exam, you will be able to pass the final exam with ease and earn good grades."
Student (Anonymous),IIT Delhi - Indian Institute of Technology [IITD],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,IITD honest review,"I personally chose CS1 which is 4 years BTECH in Computer Science and Engineering because it was the best branch I was getting with my rank. The faculty-student ratio varies from class to class though on average in the first year it will be around 1:150. But from the second year onwards it will decrease. This is because, in the first year of IITD, all the branches have the same courses. Coming up o the part of academics in IITD, it's way different from JEE academia. One needs to give equal importance to labs and classes. Also to get good grades in IITD you should keep your jee mode on cause everything is relative to grading in IITD. Also, self-study is very important for a decent 9 CGPA."
