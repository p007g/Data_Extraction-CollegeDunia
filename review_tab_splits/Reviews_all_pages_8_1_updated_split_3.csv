Ashmita Dubey,Krishna Engineering College - [KEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.5,How it feels to be KEcIAn,"As I always want to be an engineer since my childhood that's why i have opted this course.
The only best part is faculty . If students are studying in KEC every year and taking admission here is all because of great facilities. All are PhD or at least MTech . They have great knowledge about their domains and helps students  in getting's good grades in university exams.
