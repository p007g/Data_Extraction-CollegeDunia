The Biju Patnaik Institute of Information Technology and Management Studies fee structure for an MBA was high but there were many students who could really pay the fee easily. The fee could be even paid in instalments but on the stipulated dates and I think late fees would fetch a little fine. The hostels are also kind of affordable which the college provides affordable cost. The hostel fees in BIITM are 22,000 rupees for non-Ac rooms and 34,000 for AC rooms."

There are three types of modes of admission in this college. The first one is through JEE mains score cutoff which is around 89 percentile or around 80000 ranks for Computer Science and Engineering Branch. The second one is through management quota but the admission fee is a bit more as compared to the previous one. The last mode is through the merit-based selection which is based on class 12th percentage or marks. You can find the application form of this college on their official website or through AKTU counseling. The application fee is 1000 approximately. The date of the application form is released after Jee Main's result.
