Bhaskar Das,Ananda Mohan College - [AMC],"BA, English",7.5/10,Ananda Mohan College - Life in and after.,"I chose the course as I wanted to pursue the same. I developed a love for language and hence went ahead.

The faculty was one of the most amazing ones at my college. There were 3 professors in total and all three were the best in their genre.

The college was hosted in Evening time and hence, the teaching methods became different as compared to day colleges. It was challenging, yet exciting. The college hours started at 4 P.M and ended at 9 P.M. The teaching methods were energetic as teaching in evening college is much harder. The students seem much more reluctant, so the faculty had to be more strict and induce the energy within the students.

Exams were conducted at scheduled times and it was difficult as the college was under the University of Calcutta. The college was strict regarding the attendance and those students who did not complete the attendance were allowed to sit for exams after a parent-teacher meeting."

So there are over 450+ students here. And in the 1st semester there are 12 subjects. And yes we have dedicated teacher for every subject but still there is a huge teacher student ratio like one teacher takes on around 150+ students. There are 3 section divided. And few teachers like english, Librarian hardly takes their class. 
All teachers here hold a PhD Degree but except 1 or 2 teacher no one teaches in English. Not even English teachers here speaks English properly. And Quality of teaching is not very good here. If teachers would study a topic and teach it to us...it would be very feasible for the students. But I think no teacher here in Agriculture is there to help any student.
No mid term exams were held in 2021 for bsc Ag and I think direct semester would occur. There are class test but ofcourse of no use.90% students here are of Hindi medium"

There are many clubs that informed us about some of the internships we can do if we have some knowledge in some specific area like in designing, web development, etc.Till now I've not tried for internships as I'm a 1st year student and I don't have much knowledge in anything. One thing that is best here that you will get to learn many things like different different workshops were held like u have interest in coding u can learn tht , if u have interest in designing, animation, etc. That things u will learn from these clubs.

I recommend it.,"B.Tech in Computer Science is a very future proof course for getting a job in the IT companies and I liked the course from the very beginning, that's why I chose the course.
There are very good faculties present in the college (About 10-12 faculties in every Department) and the number of students is about 60-70 every department in every year.
Every faculty are M.Tech qualified and some of them are Doctorates. Their teaching quality is very good, they explain the topic very simply so that everyone can understand the topic.
There are 4 internal theory exams and 2 lab exams in each semester. If everyone classes regularly then they can easily pass the examination."
Aarti,Pusa Institute of Technology,"Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",7.6/10,Knowledge is very important along with the facility of Internship and practical training.,"The internship is provided by our college of about 4 to 6 weeks in any company of our choice as per the convenience of the students. The college provides us a letter to each student which is given to the company manager to provide us internship in his company under specialists and experts. At the end of Internship, the company provides us the letterhead which is very important and which is to be shown in the college as proof of doing an internship and gaining marks in the subject of Industrial training in the 5 th sem along with the project file made by students in which all the details of the training is mentioned like the intro of the company, layout, things we learned, etc. along with the viva voice.

The faculty at my colledge was imensely knowledgeable and talented. I liked there way of teaching and interacting with the class. The faculty was highly educated in terms of their degrees but lack communication skills. The education process was accuracte. Examinations held according to time and level of difficulty was a  little high as there was a lot of competition and relative marking system which affected student cgpa."

Student (Anonymous),Jamal Mohamed College - [JMC],"B.Sc, Mathematics",10.0/10,Nice place to study. Nice place to placement.,"I choose mathematics based on my interest because I want to become a professor.Next, I want to tell you about the faculty. Every professor completes their doctoral degree(Ph.D.). Morning men class and afternoon women class. For men student only men staff. For women only women staff. Maybe staff will change in some cases. they are not professors for us, really they are second parents. Every single doubts they explain. Hod will also handle classes. They teach in English and tamil. Teaching method is board and chalk, projector. for mathematics, they will teach everything and note it. The next test will also conduct. For arts and science college 90 days per semester. After completion of 45 days, they conduct the first internal exam and after 80 days they conduct the second internally. then semester exam will conduct. The semester exam is very easy because you are future mathematician. you have only sums and theory. No magub.for all departments is easy. Because we just write what we learn in class."

Shivam Chouhan,Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya - [SVVV],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.0/10,SVVV College review,"Life at campus cannot be expressed in just some words, it is a feeling you get when you are hanging out with your friend circle, going together to the cafeteria, bunking lectures, going on college organized trips. It's the best part of your college life. You make sweet and sour memories here and then discuss them your whole life. There are many clubs which you can be a part of and show your skills such as photography, singing, dancing, acting, etc. A decent but not too massive library where you can find all kinds of books related to your courses. There are basketball courts and a large ground for football and other outdoor sports."
Student (Anonymous),West Bengal State University - [WBSU],"M.Sc, Geography",8.0/10,WBSU-MY 2 YEAR EXPERIENCE,"After completing and getting good marks in graduation my next step is to pass MSc with first-class and prepare myself for the NET SET exam so that I can either do a Ph.D. or become a lecturer.

We had 4 faculty and almost 42 students in our department. So the student-faculty ratio is 10 students per one professor. But our professors are very good and understanding. They are very interactive in online/offline classes. They have empathy and patience to understand our topic very deeply. They also do regular practical classes. Our professors have done Ph.D. in their field.

We had 4 semesters. Every semester we had 5-6 papers and practical exams and internal assessment tests and assignments. Anyone who studies regularly can pass these exams."
Shreya Jha,Fairfield Institute of Management and Technology - [FIMT],"BA {Hons.}, English",9.5/10,College fee is not very expensive.,I chose this course because I want to improve my English knowledge and make a career in English article writing. There are a total of 80 students in two batches and around 10 faculty members. The average ratio of faculty: student is 1:8. Teachers are well qualified and experienced. The teaching method is average because they mostly teach from textbooks only. Term exam is not very difficult to pass because there is always optional question to solve.

Kavitash Kumar,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Computer Engineering",8.7/10,A college having good placement opportunities for the deserving students.,"I chose COE over CSE because it is the oldest branch in Thapar. And also the placements are quite good. Average package of COE is around 9-10 LPA. The faculty  to student in my college is approx 1:50. Most of the teachers are so humble so whenever you have any doubt or need some help in career guidance, you can contact any of the teachers for your help. The method of teaching is actually like every other in India. Most of the teachers have done Phd in related fields. But honestly I'm among those students who don't attend classes, so can't say much about that but whatever I know is faculty and their teaching method is quite good. Our college is very serious for Exams, even during Covid time they keep giving us shocks of college ready to open after 2 months only for exams. Even when no other college in India conducted offline exams, Thapar made centers in students' own cities to conduct exams.  For getting good marks in exams you have to start studying 1 or 2 weeks prior to exams."

Dushant,IIT Jodhpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITJ],,8.3/10,MBA from IIT Jodhpur,"The curriculum in the first year included courses in technology or data analytics, and we also had the opportunity to learn and practice excel with the assistance of our professors. During the first semester, there was a tools and techniques session on the schedule. Despite the fact that our professors were extremely busy, they took the time to extend these sessions and teach us essential analytical tools, which greatly aided us. Overall, we were offered a TECH-focused MBA program, which is a first in India. As a result, not only did the companies that came for Btech placements preferred us but so did the companies that came for IIM placements."
Ranjan Tyagi,Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology - [MMMUT],"MBA, General",8.3/10,MMMUT- Journey of MBA Program,"Every classroom is set up to resemble a university, and students will feel as if they are in a seminar room.
