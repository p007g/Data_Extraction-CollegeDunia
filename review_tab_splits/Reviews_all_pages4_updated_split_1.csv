Student (Anonymous),Malla Reddy College of Engineering and Technology- [MRCET],"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",6.2,HONEST REVIEW EVER,"To be honest the infrastructure is not what one would want if one is aiming for a really big campus, the campus is not big enough, and there are no clubs like music, dance, and all. Classrooms do have smartboards and it's good enough but some classrooms are very very small.
If I say for the one who only wants to study and does not want a big campus its good but for one who wants to enjoy college life and has so many expectations about college it's not happening here, they will make one only study mostly. Yes, the other activities also will be considered here but they are also mostly subjects wise like technical events and speeches and courses which will be beneficial of course, but if the rato is to be given for the enjoyment of the studies it will be around  3:10.
So, one who wants a very big campus and great infrastructures like iit's and all, this campus may not satisfy your needs."
