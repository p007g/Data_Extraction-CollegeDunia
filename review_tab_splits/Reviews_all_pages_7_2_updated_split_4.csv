Aayush Singh,Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU),"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.2,Growing day by day!,"For this year the fee is 150k which increases 10% yearly i.e., 165k for the 2nd year and so on.
There are scholarships available, which students can avail of through the e-district portal of the state government. Where they provide scholarships from 25% - 100%. These are easy to avail, and the process is also normal, in case you find difficult to fill up the form you can watch any YouTube video, they all are explanatory.
Name of scholarship: Merit-cum financial assistance scholarship
There are many other scholarships the list of which you can find on DSEU's official site.
This year's average package was 11LPA (still counting) with the highest package of 18LPA in CSE.
One of the students from CSE got an off-campus placement in Amazon with 53 LPA.
Although these are the stats when this college was under IPU and not even a single big company visited the camp, now onwards it came under DSEU and its signing MoU with many companies which means that now onwards there will be a hike in the average package."
Vamshi Krishna,Chandigarh University - [CU],"MBA, Finance",8.5,Astonishing,Exams were regularly conducted and the explanations were good staff were really good experienced and so educated speaks both English and Hindi and few speak Telugu other regional languages.

Rasool Shaik,Rao's Degree College,"B.Com, Computer Science",7.2,Rao's college And why you should join,"I chose this course as it was beneficial to me for the future course as I want to pursue CA and MBA
As coming to the ratio of faculty and students I'd say it is about 40:500 but it is not a problem because the timings are well prepared and we also have the junior lecturers who take care of us while the main faculty is not available. THE TEACHERS do explain and teach very well and they all have above 10-15 years of experience and even have their way of teaching things which gets very interesting when you listen to those classes. There are weekly tests every Saturday to test what you have learned in the whole week and the results will be announced the next Monday to keep the progress checked and give appropriate education to those who r falling back in their academics and revising everything once in a while and teaching everything is also done so it's all pretty good"

I think there is a fair bit of faculty in our college like for every subject there are two teachers one main and one associate there are approx 700 faculty and the ration is 1 teacher to 30 students. Most of the teachers are very good but some of them only waste your time. The teaching method is the same old black boar. There are exams every month for every year 2 Main semester exams 4 continuous assessments 2 Assignments and 3 lab notebooks.  The QUestions asked in the exam are a bit predictable so it is not that hard to pass exams."

The faculty is enough to handle the students. Teachers are sufficient. The office faculty members are sufficient to handle the administrative processes of all the students.

The teaching faculty is good enough. But they don't conduct enough classes to finish our syllabus. They don't attend our classes even if we have a particular subject in our routine on any given day. In short, the teachers teach well, but they are reluctant and a little irresponsible and don't guide our students well. The even semester exams are held around June - July. The odd semester exams are held around January - February. The exams are held around the time is quite regular every year. The exams are quite easy to pass if we have a basic idea."

Student (Anonymous),Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering - [DSCE],"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",6.8,DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE :),"Well, in this regard it quite backdated , considering the fact that we are living in the generation of AI ML. I chose the course since it was quite interesting, but slowly my interest gradually dipped to such an extent that i did projects related to CS branch. Some of the faculty were quite demotivating and burdened us with deadlines, some were good to be honest. One of the many drawbacks is that in ece we were taught 1990s syllabus, which made no sense. This also affected us during our placements where some the students shifted to coding like me, while others are still struggling to bag an offer. Term exams were held timely but the difficulty is above average. If you aint studying their outdated contents by heart you may even fail. And getting a fasttrack in ece at dsce is quite risky, you never know who evaluates your paper and I have seen people getting backlogs, which later proves to be a barrier during placement season.

Rohit kumar,ESI Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science and Research - [PGIMSR],"MBBS,",8.1,A glance from Esicians !,"MBBS course is of 5.5 years duration with 4.5 years of academics and 1 year of internship. 
The professors are well qualified, experienced, dedicated, and helpful. They give their best to make us good doctors. Currently, from the 2019 batch, we have the CBME curriculum from NMC guidelines to make competent doctors for the coming future. The exams are conducted timely, and the pass percentage is 70-80%, which is pretty good. A lot of clinical exposure is required to understand the different aspects of medicine. Esic medical college Kolkata has a highly equipped hospital that provides an excellent learning experience for all the medical students studying there.
Exams occur regularly with internal assessment and professional exams by University."
Student (Anonymous),Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.2,Brief about CU,"I choose this course as AI and Ml are growing fields, and at that time there were only some colleges having specialization courses, with good packages and placements.  Some faculty members are too polite and interactive, knowledgable and experienced. But there are some faculty who don't converse well with the class, overall a mixed type of faculty, similar to other universities. Here each faculty teaches more than one subject. The teaching method is convenient for all to understand. Term exams had a 2-3 day gap in between each exam, and till now it was online mode, so cannot comment much on the level of the papers, in the end, they were objective type only. This time it's physical mode so it would be clear what level of exams will there be."

Syeda Taiba Ahmad,Lady Irwin College,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Home Science",8.8,Review from the door of an Irwinite,"I have chosen this course because I am a person who loves to have variety in life. That's the most prominent reason for choosing this subject as Home Science is a multi-disciplinary subject. It offers 5 specializations ( FN, DCE, HDCS, RMDA &FAS ) to study. In the first 2 years, all 5 specializations are taught and in the final year, one specialization is chosen based on merit. The student ratio is pretty good i.e. 20:1. It has supportive and helpful faculty members who are mastered in their subjects. Examinations are held per semester after every 6 months in a scheduled manner. And it is quite easy to pass the exam with flying colors by just going through the last year's question papers"
