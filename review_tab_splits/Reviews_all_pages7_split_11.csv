The student's problems are solved by the facilities themselves.
Cons: 75% attendance criteria: It’s not the requirement itself that is the issue for studious children. It’s the fact that some way or the other you will find yourself debarred. For each subject you get debarred in, you pay a fine of Rs 2300 and attend classes during summer vacations where you won’t really be taught anything. You’ll just travel for hours to show your face so that you get your attendance."

Student (Anonymous),Acharya Nagarjuna University - [ANU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",6.3,A honest review upto my knowledge....!????????,"I choose this Course E.C.E. due my passion towards communication technologies and future demand.

In E.C.E. department the faculty : student ratio is good and it's 1:14  i.e., one faculty for 14 students.

 In E.C.E department ,Most of the faculty are M.Tech ,PhD doctarates and few are M.Tech and pursuing Ph.D(studying Ph.D). Classes will happen regularly and their teaching is  good but learning depends on matching of student learning style with professors teaching style. If any doubts we  can ask in class and staff room in working hours. The teaching method is Board and chalk.

Acharya Nagarjuna University College of Engineering and Technology follows AICTE (All India council for educational research and training) , so it follows 2 semesters per an academic year pattern.
The exams in my college are not difficult as entrance exams and at the same time not easy also, if you are able to get seat in APEAMCET you will pass easily and if you read and prepare well you will get good score."

Those students who can't afford the fees of B.Tech, they can take admission in BCA to make their dream full fill. The faculty of this course is very good and their way of explaining is quite simple. They explain all the tough concepts in very easy language and sometimes they give us practical knowledge to explain the concept. As it is technical course so sometimes it is difficult for the student to pass the exams but the hard work of the students also matters.
