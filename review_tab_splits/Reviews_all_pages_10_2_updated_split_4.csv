Abhirupa Roy,JIS College of Engineering - [JISCE],"BCA, General",9.0,College Campus Review,"I choose this course because through BCA one can choose the field of computer application as well as the field of software and web development. It is a new age course and many students choose it for their career growth.
In our institution, the student-faculty ratio is 4:1 indicates that there are 4 students for 1 teacher.
Our all teachers have an M.Tech degree and their teaching method is also good and they share the proper online materials with us timely.
Every term exams are held on after 6 months and the difficulty was average."
Divyansh Verma,ISM Dhanbad - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITISM],"B.Tech, Petroleum Engineering",8.2,Life at IIT ISM,"Well, my rank was not enough to get cse in any IIT so I start searching for special branches of a particular college and I found this as the most reliable choice as it is the only IIT in which petroleum engineering is taught and the placement scenario is also good. The professors here are highly qualified and the faculty teaching a particular class also changes often regularly there is no deficiency of professor anyhow. All the things are very professional here. The academic calendar was followed throughout and not even a single exam was postponed or preponed. The difficulty level of exams is also above average and if you didn't study throughout it is going to be tough for you to pass the exam."
Shalin Patel,L J College of Computer Applications,,7.1,Fantabulous  LJMCA,"Good Persepctive:- This is a very good college for thise students whose willingly want to do something in that life for that career they can choose this for that reason becuase it's a 5 years combined course and after compketion of this course you will get direct master degree. And as i said that it is a combined course so you have to complete 5 years study as per rules of combined course but now in case of our institute there are college give you permission to leave the college once after completion of your bachelor of 3 year if you want then and also you get the bachelor degree.Bad Perspective:- Second thing is now our LJ INSTITUTES are converted as a individual university as LJ UNIVERSITY 2 years ago so you can take the course and admission by LJ UNIVERSITY too. but there is a one problem is that institute established as a university recently so there are still some years left for LJ UNIVERSITY to get in the recommend list with all other trademark universities. so all the students must wait and keep patience for upcoming 4-5 years to take an advantage of LJ UNIVERSITY so till then you can took each course as particular and already established University like AICTE  APPROVED AND GTU or GU affiliated.Admission Process For IMCA in LJ MCA is Very Simple rather than other institute Here you can apply both via online mode and offline mode but i got admission via offline mode and in offline mode there are some prerequisites are required ws following:#students must have passed Higher secondary eduaction(12th science(A group,B group or AB group),commerce) with minimum 45%.#the criteria are student must have 45% by sum of all subjects.if students have higher than 45% they are able to get the direct admission in this course via direct offline mode."

Naveen,Amity School of Engineering & Technology - [ASET],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.3,Placement rate is high,The campus organizes the tech and cultural fest every year in February which is called 'Amitech'. There is a library where you can only get technical-related books. Although i believe there should be other genre books as well since your personality development is equally important while pursuing Engineering skills. You can also take part in different clubs and activities. I was a part of Wordsworth society and I can say that was the best decision ever.
Ashish Bhardwaj,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.2,One of the best,"No fee structure depends upon the performance of the LPU nest. without any Scholarship, the annual fee is 209000. but with scholarship, it gets reduced to even 89000 per annum.

our college welcomes the student in the first year and gives them chance to join the clubs, interact with seniors for organizing the fest, infest college again gives option either they want college fest or a road trip (a trip of enjoyment) in our time we chose the trip and that time we went to agar with zero cost from our pocket, and again in the second year of our college we gone Manali .these are the best memories  college will always make you busy if you join the club or organizers with lots of experience, the college has sports facilities, best classroom, etc"
Neeraj Verma,Bundelkhand Institute of Engineering & Technology - [BIET],"MBA, Human Resource",7.2,Best college for those people who are unable to pay collage fees,I choose the human resource course in this college because human resource teachers are very intelligent and the human resource faculty is very good than other courses faculty there are lots of course in our college like human resource Information Technology finance and marketing but I choose human resource because there is practical work also just like mini project and their innovative thinking so I prefer this.

In fact, I prefer the faculty of the subjects I like. So overall it is fine in faculties. Exams are held by AKTU, Lucknow. All affiliated colleges give the same exam. About passing exams, sometimes papers are tough, sometimes easy. But paying attention to class, faculties do help a lot to pass the exams.
But yes I would say the course curriculum, subjects that were applied in CS course by the AKTU were bit outdated. Some improvement is needed in this regard."

In every semester, there are about 2-3 faculty for a particular subject and they manage your practice as well as theoretical syllabus.

The average package starts from 2.5 lakhs p.a and extends up to 15 lakhs p.a. This depends upon company to company and also according to the interview.

Our college teachers also make the effort that their students get placed in the right company for that you have to make a better connection with teachers and prepare yourself also very well like in every yearly exam. If you have to get placed from college then you have to make sure your overall percentage should be 85 above and of course, there should be some relevant skills in you. For skills, you may take online courses from Internshala and any other platform, they provide you a certificate which will be reflected in your resume and create a big impact. If you are not placed with college placement don't worry Internshala is a big platform for job appointments you'll get a better placement than your college if you have skills.

I have participated once in Sports Meet for kho kho, though first 2 competitions we've won but lost in the 3rd round after all that matters the most that how'd you enjoyed what you are doing.

The student and professor Ratio is low as my Institute admits more students than others ITs. It is hard to find any teaching faculty having.
Qualification less than IIT level and they have good teaching idea and experience.
As per my experience in online mode, it is easy to pass due to stress free appearance but I am sure if the same difficulty level Question were in offline mode it becomes hectic but I think there is no difference b/w online or offline. In online mode, we are not getting the proper way of learning. And offline it was very interesting and easy to clear out concept.
Meanwhile difficulty level be high to get pass or success really needs hardwork."

So it's pretty cheap compared to other private colleges. However if you think you cannot pay the fees in one go, then there's an instalment system of payment too. 
Since I'm at the start of my third year now, I haven't received any jobs. However we were asked to do internships compulsorily and college couldn't bring that many internships for BBA, BCOM students so it was a pretty troublesome situation for all of us since the pandemic had already scrapped off many opportunities, and the only option left was that of work from home. But we managed. It wasn't the university's fault since the pandemic situation was tough for all of us. There are decent placements, as per my assumption and what I've heard from seniors."
