Faculty members are friendly with students as they will help students at any time. I have selected Computer Science Engineering with a specialization course in Artificial Intelligence which is in collaboration with IBM. As I have chosen the CSE AIML course because my dream is to become Data Scientist. coming to the ratio between the faculty and students in our college is around 1:24. Qualification of the faculty is good as many of the faculty have completed their PhD and also many of them have multiple degrees. In point of me, the way of teaching method is should be changed as they go around only theory but actually students require a practical way of learning. rest of all is good regarding the teaching method of the faculty. Now coming to how often our terms exam will be held is like around 1 and 1/2 months to 2 months. Passing the subject is so easy as 50% is internal and the remaining 50% is external."

Pankaj Ramani,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - [IIITD],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.3/10,All About IIIT Delhi,"Here the professors are mostly researchers. Almost every teaching faculty has a Ph.D. from abroad college in one of the fields. Also, there are guest faculty who teach various courses. Every faculty is intelligent as they have massive knowledge but teaching is a skill in itself. It also depends on the student how much he/she connects with the faculty. Getting a good score on the exams is difficult here as the course curriculum here is not like other colleges."

Mehul,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - [IIITD],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence",9.2/10,IIIT Delhi Insider review,"The course curriculum is pretty modern. Unlike major colleges in India like IITs, NITs, etc., students are not required to study physics, chemistry, or math courses in their freshman year. All major and upcoming tech domains have courses that the students can take as electives as and when they want. There are no attendance criteria for 97% of courses. The student-faculty ratio is course dependent for example for a core course for my branch the ratio may be as low as 20 students per teacher and the ratio for a common course may be as high as 100 students for a teacher. However, all the professors and TAs have a lot of office hours in which the students can go and clear doubts. The dates of the exams are fixed for a semester and the difficulty depends on the course. In addition to exams, most courses also have assignments and project work. The date of submission for these is variable though and may even be extended if many students face difficulties in them."

It includes the appearance of star actors, some concerts and DJ night along with some crazy activities organized by the clubs of the college. When it comes to infrastructure, the college stands down as all it has is 3 buildings and two canteens and is surrounded by other institutions. As the college is situated in almost the heart of the city, we can't expect much of infrastructure. The college even organises an event for Kannada rajyotsava, called 'Kannada Kalarava' at the end of November. This will be organised by a single club named 'samskruthi' which is the Kannada club of the college. 
The libraries are well equipped with plenty of books which are required for the students for academic purposes. The classrooms are well equipped but are a bit old-fashioned. Almost all clubs of the college are managed by the students themselves. Sports and cultural activities are conducted during fests."
