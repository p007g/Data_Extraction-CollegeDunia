Sheshi Kiran Reddy Mandla,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT],"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",9.5,"REVIEW ON ""VELLORE INSTITUE OF TECHNOLOGY - CHENNAI""",I chose the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course in Computer Science and Engineering as it was a hyped course during 2020 as the highest-paid job. But after joining the course I was interested and there is so much to explore in this domain. The faculty-to-student ratio is good and many faculty are having PhDs also some professors got PhDs from well-known universities such as IITs. The teaching of the faculty is good and the exams are conducted every 1 month. We will be having two midterms and final assessment exams for labs and theory and also quizzes and internal exams parallel throughout the semester. The question papers are moderately too hard as there will be a moderator for each course who reviews the question papers. So the difficulty of the paper is moderate to hard and there will be no direct questions asking for the definitions or formula but they are mostly application & scenario-based questions that develop our thinking towards the subject.

There was three types of faculty at the university, permanent faculty, some guest facility, and faculty provided by the government of India under the TEQIP scheme. The teaching method and qualifications of TEQIP faculty are excellent. Qualification of permanent faculty and HOD of each department are high but the teaching method and passion for teaching are average and about the guest faculty, I would say, they are below average. The student's faculty ratio was quite good i.e. 1:70 but in some departments like Chemical engineering and Instrumentation engineering, it is 1:40 or 1:50 due to fewer admissions in the department. There were two midterm exams for every subject and each exam is for 10 marks. To get good grades each semester, mid-term exams are very important."

We part of the M.Tech Integrated course can't leave the course after B.Tech(no separate degree) but our junior batches are free to do so. The student ratio is quite good. Some permanent faculty members might force you to attend all the lectures and do unnecessary assignments. But if you can manage you will have a lot of time to prepare for placements and do internships. They don't ask you to pay if you're attendance is less than 75% but you may get debarred from internals. Exams are done according to the exam calendar each semester. Exams are easy to clear."

Talk about socially disgusting things what should happen or what we took actions on social failure but on the other hand what it takes to good by some good people & aware persons to do so. We did take part in college functions with friends in clubs,  cultural programs, art & artillery. We made a group on tackling infrastructure problems like furnishing classrooms, repairing buildings etc. with suggestions from faculties. An annual fest like Teacher's Day;5th Sept, Eats. day;6th August etc. Some University organised programs did incept. Books & theses, and journals were to be available in the library on a rent base. Amenities in classrooms like tools, benches, boards, every tool with chemical compounds in the laboratory etc. Sports amenities had respective kits with instructors & rooms. Extracurricular activities of students by them to who took part in own fields. FB, WhatsApp etc."

SUMIT SHARMA,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - [IIITD],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.8,IIITD and it's placement,I chose this course because this was the best I was getting on the basis of my rank. IIITD has the most qualified or we can say the best faculty over other colleges which comes under JAC counselling and the faculty-student ratio is decent you cannot say anything that there are few courses in which 2 professors deal with 400-500 students divided into 2 sections or sometimes there's only a class of 10 students. Most of the faculty are very well qualified from the top Institutes all over the world. Every sem you have midsem examinations and endsem examinations after that you will be having biweekly assignments and quizzes. If you keep going with the topics taught in class then it's easy for you but if you think you will study the night before the exam then it won't work here.
Mahin Samuel John,Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College - [GNDEC],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.7,Life at GNDEC Ludhiana,"Some personal interests and the college being popular for its core b-tech branches pushed me more to opt for this course. The colllege estimately has a 1:20 ratio of faculty members to students ratio. All the faculty members are PhD students with most of them already completing their doctorate. The teachers conduct online as well as offline classes with one-to-one interaction if the student got any doubts. The teachers always welcome the students for any doubts and issues. The college appoints a mentor for 4 years of b-tech, someone from the faculty member who always welcomes the students for any issue personal or professional. The college conducts two mid-semester exams on a gap of 1-1.5 months and at the end of the semester, End semester examinations are conducted. The exam question paper is a balanced one for someone who knows how to apply practical conceptual knowledge as well as bookish knowledge. Alongside the theoretical examination, the college also holds practicals & projects."
