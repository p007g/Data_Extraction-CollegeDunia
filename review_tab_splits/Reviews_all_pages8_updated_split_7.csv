Amrita,SOIL Institute of Management,"PGP BL, Business Leadership",7.8/10,An enriching one year journey,"The institution has a place com team consisting of faculty and student members that bring in companies during the placement season. Placement purely depends on the potential of the student and his past work experience and majorly performance in the interview rounds. The college follows a standard protocol for applying to companies wherein, the student is allowed to attend an interview if his/her profile is shortlisted by the Company for their further rounds. Almost 100% of the batch gets placed every year unless students opt out of the placement cycle or remain unplaced for other disciplinary reasons. The kind of Companies that visit campus range from Banks to Consulting firms to startups and software MNCs. The average placement I believe is 11LPA. The highest placement this year was around 18 LPA from the Marketing cohort. The institution follows a hygiene factor and therefore ensures placement above the 7 LPA threshold."

Most faculty are PhD for 2nd and 3rd-year students. they are very helpful except for some of the teachers. but for the computer course, the experienced teacher is not available and those who are available leave the gla. I don't know why but currently there is a shortage of language faculty. that is very wrong they charge very high amounts still they are not focusing on faculty, they only focused on the structure of the college in one year there is 2 semester and each semester contains two exams, the First midterm is held after 1.5 monthss of the semester starting and after the 2 months of midterm end term will come of 50 marks with the practical examination.

they teach very less, it is your duty to complete it. Cause if you’re preparing for GATE/ ISRO/ DRDO or even placement, then you need to have a good grasp of the core subjects.
I am not saying that the course is bad, but, what they will do, they will teach you how to write the symbol of integration on paper, the rest you have to learn by yourself.
Here, KIIT played a masterstroke, by allotting all the good professors to the first-year students. Most of the professors who teach the senior students, are either doing research in some field or are engaged in some other activities.
Here the faculties, i.e. the lab assistants, most of them have a very basic knowledge about the subjects.  Never argue with them. Neither with professors. You never know, a single argument might ruin your career."

Some of the regular recruiters were Reckitt Benckiser, Monsanto, Syngenta, Pepsico, Godrej, Mahindra, ConAgra, Nestle, etc. The placement process during summers was (naturally) a bit less stressful. Having said that summers were considered a great opportunity as companies generally offer PPO (pre-placement offers) or PPI (pre-placement interviews) to their respective interns based on their performance during the internship. If you happen to have this PPO/PPI, you have a chance at being placed directly in these companies without having to take part in the gruesome final placements."

2. There are a total of 100 students in our batch and there are at least 2-3 assistant professors, 1 head of department, and at least 4-5 postgraduate and senior residents 
3. Assistant professor and Head of the department has already completed there pg's and has experience of 5-10 year of teaching, Senior resident had also completed their pg but the difference between sr's, AP, and HoD is that sr's have lack of experience 
4. There is an exam after completion of a particular unit and this is easy then comes the term exam which occurs after 2-3 months it comes under the category of moderate then there is pre-proof before the proof this is quite hard even for some say it's harder than proof, then finally comes off the last exam of that particular year after proof another year start bcoz results of proof usually take 2,3,4 weeks at least"

Anindya Das,Indian Institute of Management - [IIMA],"Executive, Business Analytics",9.2/10,Best MBA college in india,"The companies that come for recruitment keep changing year on year as per their recruiting needs, however, rest assured, if you have a good history of performance and you're hard-working you're likely to get placed where you like, be it an MNC or a booming start-up. Some of the regular recruiters were Reckitt Benckiser, Monsanto, Syngenta, Pepsico, Godrej, Mahindra, ConAgra, Nestle, etc. The placement process during summers was (naturally) a bit less stressful. Having said that summers were considered a great opportunity as companies generally offer PPO (pre-placement offers) or PPI (pre-placement interviews) to their respective interns based on their performance during the internship. If you happen to have this PPO/PPI, you have a chance at being placed directly in these companies without having to take part in the gruesome final placements."

Sandipan Saha,St. Xavier's College - [SXC],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Chemistry",9.4/10,"Blessed to be a student of SXC, Kolkata","I chose this course primarily to gain an in-depth knowledge in Chemistry. Chemistry is a field of science which is central to today's developing world, with virtually all areas in science having its applications. Chemistry may be a developing science, but SXC has one of the best setups in this field. 
The student-teacher ratio is relatively lower and it needs improvement.
I have experienced the teaching of the entire Chemistry department faculty, and some of them in Physics and Mathematics pertaining to my ancillary courses. Based on my overall experience, I feel that the institute teachers are one of the most qualified, the quality of teaching being one of the best. The course curriculum is sufficient for an undergraduate student to cope up with. The exams are conducted in the semester system, and are moderate to slightly difficult keeping in mind that all the students pass the examination. Therefore, as far as the syllabus is concerned, greater emphasis is laid on the class contents."
