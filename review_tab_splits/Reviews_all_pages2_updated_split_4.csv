NIT Rourkela has an 85% attendance criteria. Which is highest in India.  At the start of the first year, you will be divided into two groups having different semesters. In the first semester half will have the Electrical sem and another half will have the Electronics sem. In the 2nd semester, the courses will be interchanged.
Electronics sem is easier compared to electrical sem. But Electrical sem has more lab courses compared to electronics sem making it easier to improve the score. hence creating a Ballance between the two courses."

Frankly speaking in general faculty are good but as you all know that there are some politics inside every organisation here are also some of the faculties who do the same. But and the same time faculties are well qualified for good Universities/colleges, and there teaching methods are also good you can easily able to understand. Generally, before the finals of University college has its own test/exams which are in this format  First Mid-Term ° Second Mid-Term ° Pre-University Exam ° University Final Exam This format is for every semester."

MNCs like TATA, INFOSYS, WIPRO, etc will come to the college 
The avg package is 3LPA.
The students can get 7LPA if they have good skills 
Other than this college offers a PEGA course with some fee. It will be more useful for the students to get placed"

Tharun v,PES University - [PESU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.8,Good for a job opportunity but no fun in college life.,"Only one fest a year called Maya. 
In the Month of March fest was organized.
Books and journals are available.
Amenities in the classroom are No ac, fans yes windows, two boards, and a tv.
No extra sports activities, but yes there are club activities related to coding but held after class hours."

Nithyapriya,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT],"B.Sc, Animation & Multimedia",7.8,BIT NOIDA Review- B.Sc Animation and Multimedia,"For me, the fees were fairly costly but I found it fairly fair given the syllabus given my family's financial situation, but I felt more things could've been done to justify the cost. Scholarships are available and offered in all semesters except the first one in various categories to which the student can apply. However I found it sorely disappointing and a bit stressful because the result list is not posted at all, or not on all the websites and there is no response either, even if you are eligible and make it into the list, you will not know as they don't inform you themselves. From personal experience, I've had to run constantly after them for any response and help but at least you get the refund even if it's late. I myself got 40% freeship in tuition fees in the second semester under compassionate grounds and full merit in tuition fees in my 5th semester. I hope they improve and post the results on all campus websites and inform the students who made it on the list to apply for a refund."
Arya Abinash Nayak,Udayanath College of Science and Technology,"MA, Odia",8.6,Udayanath autonomous college in short,The annual function seminar and many types of cultural activities was great there are many books to read in library environment is soo good classroom infrastructure environment good sports and NCC is great opportunity for this college also raised programme for extracurricular activities many websites run by people
Saurabh Singh,GL Bajaj Group of Institutions - [GLBGI],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.7,Enough Details to know,I choose the ECE branch since I have to become a scientist and pursue M.Tech in avionics. In ECE  for 130 students there are 20 faculty for teaching and 10 for lab.  All teaching faculty have qualifications up to PhD They give brief knowledge about the subjects and also help after college time get over They conduct 2 sessional tests and 1 PUT (previous university test) about every 50 days . If you are consistent and have proper notes then you can easily pass the examination. But if you show any laziness then you have a lot of pressure at the time of the examination.
Samrudhi  S Ruikar,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Com, General",7.3,Review on VIT Vellore,"The faculty-student ratio is good the batch size is 260 and for each subject, we have 3-4 faculties.

Krupa S,PES University Electronic City Campus,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.6,short bits of PESEC.,"I chose this course because it has scope for the future.
The faculty here are so friendly and are reachable anytime.
about 90% of faculty are Ph.D. holders who have vast knowledge about the field they are in.

MAYANK,Institute of Technology & Science - [ITS] UG Campus,"BBA, General",5.0,Unfiltered truth,"Collage will tell you that they will give you good placement in many stabilized companies and many A1 companies but its nothing but a lie they will provide you with the company with an internship period and after that, they will not make you permanent and they also have tie up with the companies which use to give students internship opportunities and then they will make a deal and take your half salary for themselves."
Student (Anonymous),PES University - [PESU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.8,The pros and cons of PES UNIVERSITY.,The placements record of pes is pretty good. The avg package was about 15lakhs/year. The highest package was 1.5cr last year that's just amazing. 90% of the people here get placed with high packages. I'm planning to go to the UK for a master's and it's easier with a degree from such a Prestigious college like PESU.
Shubham Kumar,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.7,SRM Institute of Science and Technology,"My course is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering). 
I chose this course because of my interest in the subject, as well as the excellent placement my college offers in this department. 
The faculty: student ratio is close to 1:3, which is a good number. 
Most of the faculties I have came across till now are PhD holders. 
The teaching method used by most of the faculties is by using pre-made presentations by the college faculties. They use it to lead the course systematically, while also using the conventional, explanation on the blackboard. They give questions and also try to explain the practical implementation of the topics. 
The exams are properly placed throughout the semester to give enough time for the students to prepare for the next exams or do any other co-curricular activities they might be interested in. 
We have 3 cycle tests, and finally semester exams every semester. 
The difficulty of the exams is moderate. Just give enough time to every subject."
Sohum,PES University - [PESU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.5,An Honest Opinion About PESU,"The fests is a part where PESU is a little weak. Plus in EC campus the hostel for 1st years is at a different location away from the college. The hostel inside the college is only for 2nd,3rd and 4th years, so the hostel synergy is low for first year. Most of the sports are available including many like badminton, basketball, etc. With the new MRD sports centre opening up hopefully it will get better. For now the only 2 badminton coursts they have are outdoor and since Bangalore weather is always windy, it is difficult to play.
The library has most of the books required but it's better to get the course books early since other people also want them.
There are many clubs and social groups. I am sure you will find somewhere where you will get interested."
Shripad Parchure,PES University Electronic City Campus,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.6,PES EC CAMPUS - MUST READ REVIEW.,"The classroom and labs are up-to-date that is having all the modern requirements for a system. The research labs are good. Fest is also there but for my first year, it was held just before any internal exam.
Sports fests also are available. sports like football, cricket, and badminton can be played. 
Classroom amenities are good. Ventilated, having TV display and bright.
Club activities are also exciting and this university has a large number of amazing clubs. All extracurricular activities you search for you get here.
From singing to dancing to beatboxing to hackathon and hack nights.
You get all the books in the library of the university."
