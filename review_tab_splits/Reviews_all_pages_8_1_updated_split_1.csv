But I have seen it in symbiosis college so I took the admission. The teaching faculty is very good and they cleared my all doubts and are very helpful. 
Qualification of teaching faculty is that they are professionals in their teaching field so they clear the doubts very easily. There are 2 semesters held in college only and for ACCA Papers you get an exemption of 6 papers so you have to give just 7 papers and you are an ACCA affiliate with a Bcom degree in accounting and Finance.

You will find here a number of specialized professors for every subject. There is no shortage of professors and at the time of projects, a group of 3-4 students gets one professor, which makes a 4:1 student-teacher ratio for a class. Term exams start and get over on time and questions asked are from the syllabus and lectures only. If you have attended the lectures properly you would pass the exams comfortably."

Sachin Chaudhary,Graphic Era Hill University - [GEHU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.2,Honest review of Graphic era hill university,The annual fest is Grafest and it was held in the month of October every year. There is a separate block of library and each and every book and journal is available. And now a new library is also constructed which is the biggest library in Asia. All classes are smart classrooms and some of them are air-conditioned and well furnished. All the sports facilities are available on the campus and there is a separate ground for every game and daily other activities happening on the campus. Codzilla is a coding group of our college that was run by 2 nd year students and there are many groups.
Nitya Shree,Bharati College - [BC],"BA {Hons.}, English",9.0,An Underrated Off-Campus College,"Being a girls' college, there are prejudices that people have, but Bharati has changed my perspective about girls' colleges. There is a sense of sisterhood and strength, and there are inspiring women all around from all types of backgrounds, making it a safe space for women. You may not get the OG Delhi University vibe here since the college itself is away from the campuses, but that doesn't mean it is not worth it. In the end, it is not the campus or fests or infrastructure that really makes a college good enough, it is the people. At Bharati, almost everyone finds their people to make memories with. You will find all types of people, but more often than not, you will find good people. The societies are the best ones of the University of Delhi. Be it Artvilla, the art and aesthetics society or Advaita, the western dance society. Even the fests, like Phagun, are fun-filled."

Shreya Koner,Himgiri Zee University - [HZU],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Agriculture",8.2,Honest talk about my college,"I chose this course because there are lots of opportunities in every sector starting from banks to MNCs. The path is wide. 
The faculty in my college is really good. Like everyone is highly qualified and has expertise in the subject matter. The Head of the department holds a Ph.D. degree. Faculty: student ratio would be somewhere around 100:200.
The maximum of the faculties are having a Ph.D. degree in a particular subject and some are having MSc degrees. The teaching method is too good and easy to understand. Notes are provided and they also help by suggesting names of good books to which I can refer. 
The exams were exactly on time and I studied well so for me it was not that tough to pass an exam."
