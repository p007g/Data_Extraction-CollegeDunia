karan,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Information Technology",6.8,Insider of DTU,"In the third year, companies do come to get interns from here, they also do give a very decent stipend too.  Some people get a PPO after internship and they get placed in that company and most do get their placement in 4th year. Almost all big brands and companies come for placements each year, although the placements are higher in the technical branches as compared to the core branches."
SAMEER SANGWAN,Guru Tegh Bahadur Institute of Technology - [GTBIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.8,,"I liked the electronics and communication branch as we all know it has a great and successful future ahead. and it's also an evergreen branch that is its employment rate is better than CS, IT. every company needs ELectrical engineers. I quite liked the infrastructure of this college, it is strictly compulsory for Sikh students to wear proper turban daily. The facility: student ratio is quite decent.
The teaching is good, labs are well maintained. the faculties are very qualified in their respective fields. They know how to teach and handle students, i.e; they are strick for studies but highly supported too. Internals and Externals are held timely, study leaves are provided, level of the paper is very much decent, though lab viva is kind of tough but if prepared well, nothing to worry about then."

Student (Anonymous),Medi-Caps University,"B.Tech, Information Technology",7.7,Nice college. But there is strict 75% attendance criteria,"In the 5th semester, we have to give mini project (in cs/it) and in 7th and 8th semester we have to give major projects. We can make this project alone or in a team of 3 people
At the end of each year we have to do internship as per mandatory criteria. If we have to do internship or industrial training from the college itself then we are eligible for this opportunity as well. There are several faculties assigned. College provides courses like aws cloud,web development, Blockchain, Data Science etc for industrial training. No stipend if you are opting for campus training. Instead you have to pay for it."
Harsh Vardhan,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Computer Engineering",6.2,NSUT life by a first year (pandemic),"I chose CSDS because I discovered my potential in class 11th that I really was into doing some code and I had been doing UI/UX design for a while back then and always wanted to create a real working app. These sorts of wishes and milestones set me on this path.
There is one faculty for each subject teaching almost 60 students. So id say there is a 1:60 teacher-student ratio per subject. 
I honestly don't remember any qualifications of the faculty, most didn't tell and I never bothered asking. But the teaching methods were great. studying for two semesters id deduce that 8 out of every 10 faculties are excellent in their job.
There were a lot of exams and short tests for every subject. 7 exams for one subject including Vivas and short tests."
Mahir ali,Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre,"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",9.5,A brief review of my college.,"The ability to pay varies widely among the students. The fees was already right from the inception of the law schools, but the rs 70000 per annum or so fee was not found to be something unmanageable even by those who didn't have the money as benks were forthcoming with education loan as even the bank were aware of the 100% recruitment rate in nujs. There is no doubt that expenses are increasing and fees paid by the students is the source of income from the law schools like nujs which take pride  in its financial independence.
However, aanyone familiar with the law school sceneries will be able to tell you that some very important thing have been overlooked.
I didnt got any scholarships from government but I got scholarships from college. That is very beneficial for me at that time. And now at this time the fees are hike and its sometimes difficult for many students to give this type of money. It seems like a good time to be a electrical engineering and I will be able to tell you that"

Secondly, as I am traveling less that means I will be less tired and can contribute more time in my studies or extra curricular activities that I am interested in . The third reason is the cost at which the course is been provided is really amazing .As it's an professional course you will get your graduation degree after completing your 3 years. Admission process is really simple you have to enroll yourself through their official site that is brsnc . After you got selected you have to provide your marksheet for verification and you have to go through registration procedure.

I have a mixed opinion about the faculties of this college, some are good some are not good. but the ratio of faculty to student is ample , that is around 1 teacher to 50 students.
There are very highly qualified teachers in the colleges some are having master degree from IIT's and some are from foreign reputed universities, and the teaching method is good altogether and could be easily explainable to any student.
Term exam were not on time at all as all things were out of order due to covid and the exams were diffcult to provided that the semester was too short to study any subject and thier was not enough time to study for exams."

I choose LPU because i got scholarship upto 45% till the end of the program actuall fees was 70000 I'm paying approx 37000. Website for admission - admit.lpu.in , and www.lpu.in"

Anurag Juyal,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",6.6,NSUT maybe worth it,"I always had an interest in electronics, so I decided that I will take ECE in an NIT/DTU/NSUT or if I got into IIT, I will take ECE or else EE. After finding out that NSUT has the best ECE as it's the oldest branch there, I decided on NSUT ECE.

The class size here is about 60 which isn't too bad. The teachers are well qualified but knowing something and being able to teach it are two different things. Similar to almost everywhere else, there are a few excellent teachers and a few not-so-great teachers who only read PDFs in classes. As I have only taken online classes, I can't be sure about their teaching proficiency offline.

For 1st semester, after a short 3-month online semester with 1 viva, 1 long, and 3 short tests, we were supposed to give offline end semester exams. 1st sem results aren't out yet but a few teachers have told us that quite a lot of students have been failed. Also, all exams including end sem, all subjects' exams are taken on consecutive days without any gap in between"

Due to Covid one semester was completed in 3 months and in between that there were 3 unit tests, 1 practical test and 1 Viva test. Unit tests are towards the Hard side so that we can perform good in Semesters Exam, Viva is easy but for that, you must know the concept.

Anand Singh,Sirifort Institute of Management Studies,"B.Com {Hons.}, General",4.0,Review For my College,"After the 5th semester, students are eligible for campus placement.
Many local companies come for campus selection.

There are very few students who get placement through college
After my bachelor's degree, I have a plan for a master degree."
Chandrima Laha,Himalayan University - [HU],"BA, General",10.0,DETAILED REVIEW OF HIMALAYAN UNIVERSITY,"I have chosen this course because graduates from BA degree programmes have many more career opportunities and tend to earn more than those without an undergraduate degree. In addition to the professional benefits, obtaining a BA degree can have great personal advantages as well. BA programs present students with challenges that improve their creative thinking, problem solving, and interpersonal and communication skills among others.
The faculty to students ratio of our college is 1:17.
Our college has Qualified and Competent faculty members who take care of every student in the academic subjects as well as in their social training, and the faculty members are also involved in bringing about correct social behaviour in the students. This is the essence of discipline at our college and our faculties use a variety of methods-individual, groups and whole class teaching accordingly as per the needs of the students."

Talking about faculty there are a good number of friendly teachers, they are ready to help you at any point of time, academically they are good and educated.
There are several PhDs in our college, many have good methods of teaching, but few new teachers have come they need to be better but I think is this a new experience for them so they might be nervous.
After the end of each sem that is 3 months or so we had a semester exam If you ask me the exams are moderate difficulty level but the vtu's correction system is not that appreciable and this was a drawback back then but now BMSIT doesn't come under vtu so it's a good thing for the new people joining."

We had around 42 students in the class. But, not all students had a steady attendance. Thus, around 30 students would be present in the class each day. The teachers are highly trained and help the students in all possible ways. They also encourage the students to take up challenging tasks at college. The teachers are very specific to details and therefore, the assignments need to be completed neatly and within the given deadline. The exams are conducted by Calcutta University and are taken in the months of July (for even semester) and December (for odd semester). However, you hardly get any semester breaks.

Lords University, School of Law offers various kinds of scholarships among students to encourage their inclination towards the law field and to overcome their financial constraints, ensuring such hurdles don’t affect their career in law. 
Lords University has scholarships for students who are financially weak. The university provides a whole five-year course free of cost to such kinds of students.

I myself didn't go for campus placements because though the companies come in the college but the packages are very few, and most of the students don't prefer to go for campus placements. 
Personally, I don't have any idea about what is the highest package or what is the average package because most of the students don't prefer to sit into the campus placements because of fewer packages. 
I have already passed my college and now I am preparing for government exams and other students who are not preparing for government exams can prepare for MBA."

Jayesh Gaikwad,Kishinchand Chellaram College - [KC College],"B.Sc, Information Technology",9.6,Great College With Enjoyable Campus Life In Mumbai.,"I wanted to do engineering in computer science or information technology but my marks in CET were less and didn't give JEE exams also. But I loved this field of computers and doing work on computers was my childhood dream. that's why I choose this course. Then after doing some research over the internet, I found out that In B.Sc Courses Of Computer Science/Information Technology the study Is the same and there are very few differences in courses that I will be getting In these two of them. So I decided to join B.Sc In Information Technology and after studying it for 3 years and comparing with BE In Computer Science/Information I found that everything was same. But In BE the study was in depth and In BSc, the study was in a little bit of depth not very difficult. In my college, there are lots of departments available in different courses and the student ratio is also maximum. My course has a 3 years period. Teachers are great at teaching every subject. Exams are very difficult to pass and score"

Saptarshi Dutta,Techno Main Salt Lake,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,"Techno Main Saltlake, A college for new generations.","In my case, I don't get the opportunity to go and experience classes due to Corona. In December, Our Induction Programme started where we all were introduced to our teachers and our Cultural Clubs. At that time, we got some tasks from the club in order to give more interaction. In January, Our main classes started. Most of the teachers were very professional and delicate. But due to Corona, we have to face many problems like network issues, app crashes and especially daily household disturbances. Although, we were able to tackle those problems and now we know how to deal with them but still I think the environment which we can get in college is way better than this. The face to face discussions, chats and arguments will improve our way of living in near future, which we don't get in  Online classes."
