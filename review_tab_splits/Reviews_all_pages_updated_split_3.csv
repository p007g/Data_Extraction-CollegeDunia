Student (Anonymous),Government Engineering College - [GEC],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.5,GEC COLLEGE BHAVNAGAR COLLEGE REVIEW,"This course is very use full in today because everything is digital, and online. So electronic and communication engineering is in High demand.
After a few years in electronic and communication engineering very High demand for some semiconductor companies established in India. ex.vedanta, Marcon etc. This course is in design for circuits, IoT devices, digital communication channels, embedded systems or devices etc.
In this college, the faculty is very knowledgeable. Most of the sir & mam are completed ME, PhD, and gpsc.
Faculty knowledge is technical and practical."
Krishna DUgad,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0,2nd yrs life at mitwpu,"so I think day by day it is getting costlier to educate a student because there are only limited seats available in goverment colleges where the cost is less, unlike private colleges where there is no limitation of seats but the fees are higher. One good thing about my university was that they appreciated my score on the MHT-CET exam and gave me a scholarship of 25% on a year's fees. This helped me a lot as the money saved was the money used to buy me a laptop which is necessary for a better understanding of things."
Jay patel,L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",8.4,"Review on best govt college of Gujarat, LDCE",LD college of engineering is a government college so there is only 1500rs fees per year. You are also getting MYSY scholarship if you are staying in hostel. Even if you don't you are getting 5000rs per sem for study expenses from MYSY scholarship. While applying for any scholarship they ask for college fees. So there are very less chances of getting scholarship. In course Artificial intelligence and machine learning companies mostly don't hire freshers as this is very responsible task and you'll require company's data for it.
Vedant,Vishwakarma Government Engineering College - [VGEC],"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",5.7,Review of vgec,As I joined the college recently so the faculties told us about the opportunity in sports and other activities. The institute also gives us the opportunity to join in NCC (National cadet corps). The library of this college is quite good you can read or learn anything over there. The institute also gives students the opportunity to innovations made by students and also provides funds to them through SSIP or E-cell. And campus of this college is good but they can improve the campus by maintaining more.

Technical fests are conducted before URVI so you can consider it as a part of it, tech fests are less. The library and canteen are rated only average too, the books in the library are only related to the subject and nothing else. The canteen doesn't provide various options, classrooms are average too. Sports facilities are ok, TT is bad but basketball, carroms, and badminton are good. There are few social clubs and NGOs like ""with you"", the rest are common like music, dance, etc"

Siddharth,Amity School of Engineering & Technology - [ASET],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.4,True review for Amity School of Engineering and Technology,"Placement usually starts from the 7th sem and at the end of the 6th sem, we have to do one internship for a month or two. There are many companies who have visited Accenture, Palo Alto, Shell, Amazon, Autodesk, International companies for giving jobs abroad, Tredence, Juspay etc. High-paying companies take 3-4 students with them, and avg paying companies take 8-12 students.
The highest package offered was 60LPA by Palo Alto taking 4 students. An average package is around 7LPA.
Amity tries to give their 100% to ensure 100% placement,  but few students have their family business and few go for higher study like MTech, MBA."

There are approximately 10 to 15 teachers in our maths departure but the no. of students is approx. 8 to 9 times the no. of teachers in a particular class so that they can't take all the students seriously and they only think that if the front seater understands then the whole class understands and they don't get a think about the backbenchers. I think their qualification is way better than their teaching methods but few teachers are good at teaching, most of them are qualified from good universities but their teaching method is just disgusting I don't know how they pass the exams. The term exams are of 3 hours and the exams are way too different from every year like there are questions from our syllabus but I don't know how can they change the meaning of questions. The teachers who check the exams they always give fewer marks for every lengthy answer no matter how lengthy we write so it's way too difficult to pass the terms."

That's all not true because if you are thinking of choices to this side or that side without any idea about them, then you mostly end up at the software side so think carefully about what you want and if u have no choice of getting a seat in cse then choose this course.
And I don't mean that you shouldn't go hardware side after all it's your choice.
In this college, for this course, I don't think there is any scope for going hardware side. The faculty is good and you can gain knowledge only if you are truly passionate about the course then it will help. The faculties are well experienced and they are friendly. If you are willing to. learn they will definitely help you. For exams, you can pass easily as it's an autonomous college. Exams are not that difficult jntu"
