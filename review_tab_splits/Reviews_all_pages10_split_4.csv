The faculty and student ratio is 1 teacher for 120 students. The faculty members were well qualified and well versed in communicating with the students. Some teachers PhD as well. The teaching method was good as there was a regular conversation between the teacher and the students and at each term exam before the internals, there was a presentation that was to be done by the students for marks. Which actually has helped each student to improve on their own presentation skills. There was a whiteboard and projector as well to teach properly. The term exams were on time after a month of the start of 1st term we would have our internals for 20 marks and 5 marks presentation. And after 2 months we would have our final exams for 75 marks. The exams were good for those who studied and bad for those who didn't. The exam paper had questions which they taught in the class and some questions which really made us think."

Student (Anonymous),Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Information Technology",10.0,Life at CU 2021,Some teachers are inexperienced but experienced teachers are also present in each department.

* My college is not very big, and that doesn't even matters. Approx 15 teachers are there in my college. According to my best knowledge, our college's faculty to student ratio would be 1: 40, which is very good according to me, as each student gets good attention from the teacher.

The teaching method is dependent on each teacher and most teachers doesn't get a chance to share their knowledge in great detail because of Less TIme but If you ask them questions or doubts outside class hours they will definitely give you much more knowledge.
There are total 4 major exams in one year and If you want to just pass it maybe say around 6-8 pointers then you can just study for 10 days but If you want above that then you have to regularly attend lectures (to just get overall idea and concept of topic) and study regularly to get 8 above pointer.But the curriculum is designed in such a way that you have to study whether there are exams or not."

Student (Anonymous),MBM Engineering College - [MBM],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",5.7,Internships at MBM,"I choose this course because I was largely interested in Computer Science from the 10th class. So I had already decided that I'll pursue my B.E. only in CS.

There's no strict ratio for the whole college, it depends from department to department. In some departments, it's really good and some departments are really bad. But overall speaking it's pretty decent like you won't face any difficulty only because of the ratio.

Like always, some faculties are really dedicated towards their profession and others just want to enjoy their salaries. But since the govt. introduced TEQUIP, maximum of faculties re young blooded and passionate to teach. So if someone wants to study he'll enjoy studying here.

EXAMS, that's where our college lags behind. We have no academic calendar (because of some internal political matters) and due to which exams always get delayed a little. But they're not that tough so you're not worried so much about the exams."

Nisha,IIT Guwahati - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITG],"B.Tech, Chemical Engineering",9.3,College Review of IIT Guwahati,"The fee is a bit high but it's fair according to other private colleges in the race and it's totally worth paying this fee here. The total fee per semester including mess and hostel charges comes around INR 1,35,000 so for 8 semesters means complete 4-year course becomes INR 10,80,000 and you can add few other expenses also. Banks easily provide education loans for IITs and many students opt for that. Out of the total fee, INR 1,00,000 is the tution fee which, SC/ST/PWD students need not pay. Also if a student's parent's annual income is less than 1lacs, he/she also need not pay tution fee and if parent's annual income is between 1lacs to 5lacs then the student has to pay only 1/3 of the tution fee. Hostel mess charges are the same for everyone. Also, there are other schemes like SC/ST/PWD students get a laptop from the college's side, they only need to pay 10% of the actual price."
