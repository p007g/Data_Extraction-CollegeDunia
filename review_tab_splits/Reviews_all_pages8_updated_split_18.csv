The teaching method in our college is quite unique. There are no books or notebooks provided by the college as everything is online. An application called Google classroom is used to study the material posted by the faculty. In our college, the commerce stream has the highest number of students. Speaking about the exams, the syllabus is completed very earlier compared to other colleges. You'll get plenty of time to prepare for the exams and the exams are conducted very punctually. It's very easy to pass your semester if you complete and submit your assignments on time and do your internal exams well. It is a great place for your to opt for your education only. Sounds weird but our college doesn't have any cultural or feasts. Placements are very good compared to any other colleges in Coimbatore."

Computer Science and Engineering is the second-best course in the college in my opinion after the B.E. computer science course. Yes, these are two different courses. At the time of admission, the first one was the one that I could get into based on my marks and rank. Both the courses have the same course material taught, only the latter has more students admitted and thus has more competition amongst peers. Every branch is divided into batches of 60 students approx. for lectures and 30 for labs, each having one teaching staff which makes the faculty: student ratio pretty good. The exams in Thapar are divided into sessional and mid term and final term exam. Before each term exam you have a sessional exam/quiz for each subject taught and a lab evaluation(which is counted into sessional exam) if the subject has practical credits. So the exams happen very frequently and is relatively easy to pass if you perform average in every test but the term exams are still moderately difficult."

Even we all are in the process of understanding it and what I can understand so far is that Magic of lsr can be seen in the girl's who has been/is/will be a part of lsr. Girls who become too much confident, fearless, and vocal as human being no matter how she looks, from where she is, and what language she speaks. Lsr gives a unique power to everyone, to stand for justice, to speak for right, to fight for yourself. Magic of lsr is within every lsrite. The magic of lsr is because of every lsrite. We girls together make the magic of lsr. This unity makes us special. Unity is our strength."

They even provide materials so it makes work easy. About examination, it's best at its place and yes it's easy to pass if prepared well. They conduct two internal exams and one external main per semester. But one thing is that sometimes we can’t use our own language in theory exams.

It's not quite enough as students can’t ask teachers about his/her doubts comfortably. Although teachers give their best to solve the problems of students. They even provide materials so it makes work easy. About examination, it's best at its place and yes it's easy to pass if prepared well. They conduct two internal exams and one external main per semester. But one thing is that sometimes we can’t use our own language in theory exams. One thing faculties should share is the importance of their subject so based on that students can choose the right career."

For the 2020 batch, there were 630 students: 50 teachers - a fairly 13:1 ratio. The teaching staff at NMIMS is the glory of the course - all teachers are industry experts who teach not only using the material but also real-life examples and case studies which make the course more authentic and practical.

The faculty was one of the most amazing ones at my college. There were 3 professors in total and all three were the best in their genre.

The college was hosted in Evening time and hence, the teaching methods became different as compared to day colleges. It was challenging, yet exciting. The college hours started at 4 P.M and ended at 9 P.M. The teaching methods were energetic as teaching in evening college is much harder. The students seem much more reluctant, so the faculty had to be more strict and induce the energy within the students.

Exams were conducted at scheduled times and it was difficult as the college was under the University of Calcutta. The college was strict regarding the attendance and those students who did not complete the attendance were allowed to sit for exams after a parent-teacher meeting."
