Student (Anonymous),Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.2,Most genuine Review from a DCE(now DTU) Student.,"Frankly, I chose this course becoz of rank and also ECE is best after tech branches and I didn't want to go into tech branches. The best thing is we have 3 paths ie core, tech, and a consultancy where big 4 companies like Deloitte also recruit.
The faculty-student ratio is around 1:96 and it becomes around 1:68 in further years.
All professors are highly qualified and publish many research papers every year still Frankly all professors are not good, those old ones who are bored of teaching the same subject for years are also there, PHD scholars who are their assistants are generally enthusiastic in teaching since they have more energy and realte to students problems,
The course curriculum is quite relevant to today's industry needs. 
The difficulty level is relatively less as compared to iit's bcoz the curriculum is relatively lighter and also all the students are not top rankers and got admission due to state domicile. So it is best for those who just want to find out his/her passion, will get exposure."
