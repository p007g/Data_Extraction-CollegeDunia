Syed,NIMS University,"B.P.T,",6.5,"Honest review for Bachelor's of Physiotherapy at Nims University, Jaipur","In my case, I was inclined towards physiotherapy because of its treatment methods and rehabilitation. Also, it has a great scope if you have good hands skills, which comes with practice. 
I choose NIMS university for physiotherapy as its fee structure is quite low as compared to other private colleges and also it has a super speciality hospital with a great patient flow which is necessary for medical students.
The faculty here are good. In the physiotherapy department, all faculties are mpt or Phds. And for medical subjects in the physiotherapy department, we have faculties from its medical college, who are quite good. Their teaching method involves smart classes for theory and practical labs and Dissection Hall for practicals.
Faculty to students ratio is not good as there are 350+ students in one batch and we face problems in class interactions.
BPT here is a semester-wise course so we have our one semester of approx 6 months during which there are 2 sessional and 1-semester exams."
Pranjal,Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology - [MSIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.0,MSIT - Place to aspire,"The course and curriculum are very vast at msit. They follow the curriculum issued by GGPSIPU University. In BTech there are 4 branches CSE, IT, ECE, EEE. In the first year you have to study a lot of subjects which may not be part of your course but it is important to give basic knowledge about engineering. I chose this course because I was really interested in computer science and wanted to become a programmer. The faculty present here is strict but at the same time very helpful. Discipline is very important for them. The faculty is very knowledgeable and qualified, they have published their own research papers and many more which you can access at www.msit.in. Exams are mostly conducted on time and the level of exams is moderate if you will follow what the teacher is explaining it is easy to pass."

Tanuj goswami,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Environmental Engineering",7.5,Join DTU you will not regret when concerned about placement and Campus life.,"I was a bit interested in this section and it looks too different from the other core and technical branches. So for the sake of diversity in my course, I choose this one.
As the no. of students in my class is 82 so those can be managed easily and the ratio is around 
1:10. The qualification of teachers is very good they are alumni of IITs and other top government institutions and they have plenty of good knowledge and the method of delivering that knowledge is very good.
Term exams are in 2 parts 
Mid sem- comes after 2 months of starting a semester they are like 25 or 20 marks and a bit easier to score in them.
End sem- Yeah here they check your speed and patience both at the same time. Your collection of words should be good in the answer sheet to score more. 
This consists of 50 marks and by studying for a week you can score good marks and if you want to be a topper you have to be consistent in your studies.
And normally the checking portion is decent."

Student (Anonymous),Maharaja Surajmal Institute - [MSI],"BCA, General",6.4,Review on My college,I choose this course because of the increase in jobs in this sector and to keep in mind that the future will be all about computer technologies. Faculty is divided according to the department and each department consists of approx 20 teachers there are a total of 300 students in one year and bca is for 3 years so the faculty: student ratio can be 1:45. All faculty have done their masters and some are pursuing higher studies like Ph.D. Some teachers are good some are bad at teaching but they all are good in nature there are exceptions. Term exam time was a high-pressure time but if you study normally throughout the sem then the exam would be a piece of cake for you. And faculty will help you if you do not do good in your exam.

One is in mid sem and the other one is end of the semester
Exams are not that difficult .you can easily get good marks but a decent amount of study is required because there will be relative grading."

Venna Raghunatha Reddy,Aurora's Degree College,"B.Sc, Computer Science",9.0,Aurorian Review,"In this college fee structure is some what high but the standards will be maintained accordingly. When I was studied it was around 39000 for first year and the fee will be raised every year l, as I remembered I paid around 47000 in my last year. So I paid nearly one lakh twenty thousand for my entire degree to complete but it will be worthwhile if you use the resources properly like library, placement assistance etc.. I got internship offer from the company Sutherland in my last year but I didn't join because of my personal reasons. Our college is collaborated with big companies like Deloitte, Sutherland,Tech Mahindra, TCs and many more. They also provide CRT classes to give you the placement assistance and thus it's easy to get the job if you use all the resources properly here.

The ratio in the CS course is approx. like 4:1.
The faculty is good but a few of the faculty despite being knowledgeable and sometimes fail to deliver the exact knowledge.
Otherwise, every faculty is qualified more than enough.
For each semester there are 3 assignments with 10 marks each, 2 class tests with 30 marks each, and a pre-University exam with 100 marks, and then the university exam with 100 marks.
Every exam is not very difficult to pass."

Shaik Mohammed Asif Ali,Rajeev Gandhi Memorial College of Engineering and Technology Nandyal - [RGMCET],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",7.8,My College My Experiences.,"I chose Civil Engineering as I was quite interested in the particular course and also because of government job opportunities.
The faculty: student ratio is Around 20-25 faculty 160 students. The minimum qualification for teaching is Mtech and for lab assistants it is btech. The college will follow its own regulations in terms of teaching. Both practical and theory related will be in the same semester for a better understanding of subjects. There will be two-semester which have 1 External exam, and 2 internals exams, the first internal be held with 2 and half months start of the course and the next before the start of the external exams of the semester. The external exam will be at the end of one semester which has 6 months duration.
The exams will be more of a problem in nature and one needs to have a good idea of the entire syllabus of the subject to pass the exam."
Aryan Vishwakarma,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",6.0,NIT Agartala pros and cons,"So I like some branches out of which electrical was the one, but however, I got this branch in the JOSAA counselling. And the faculties are not very much support if you are planning to prepare for some other exams, but with respect to the subjects (course subjects), faculties will help you, not all the faculty but there will be some faculty who will help you.
Student ratio: the student ratio of my department is more towards the boy side, i.e. if a class has 40 boys then there would be 20 girls. 
For each year there will be 2 semesters, and each semester has mid-semester exams and end-semester exams. So overall in a year, you will have two mid-sem and two end-sem.
And preparation, if I would tell you, is very easy if you even sincerely study just two-three days before the exam you can easily score a very good score."
Shobhit Yadav,Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology - [PSIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,Best College for Learning.,"I have craziness about Computer so that's why I choose this course.
