No matter what, electrical is the only option my mind will accept. Coming to the faculty-student ratio, it doesn't matter as far as the class is interesting (electrical as always is), engaging and lively. Teaching methods of faculty cannot be generalized as the faculty teach using different methods and all of it can't be categorized into one, yes there are few boring ones, but the important subjects are given to the best faculty. Hence the problem is solved. But, it's too much to take all the faculty into one place, as every human being has their own potential and methods. Tey, the improvement can be done by taking honest reviews anonymously from trustworthy students. It will be too much to comment on exams as it is completely dependent on JNTUH. Our college has very negligible authority to change the exam pattern or what so ever. Since it is an autonomous institution, the difficulty was slightly on the lesser side."
