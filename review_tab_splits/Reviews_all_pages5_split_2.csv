Chirag Hadiya,IIT Goa - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITG],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.8,Short and better review of IIT Goa,"The annual fest is cultural and technical fest is Cepheus. The library at IIT Goa is well-stocked with books, journals, and other resources. The library has a collection of over 10,000 books and subscribes to several online databases, providing access to thousands of research papers and journals. The classrooms at IIT Goa are well-equipped with modern amenities such as projectors, whiteboards, and comfortable seating arrangements.

Priyanshu Raj,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.8,NIT Jamshedpur at a glance,"Fees are high to be honest, in a government college, we think to get world-class facilities at low fees but fees are high, but you have no need to worry, SBI gives special loans to nit students with a low rate of interest and some state governments also give loans to poor students.
Fees hike policy is not good for us general middle-class students as we have to struggle to make ends meet and then we also got to have laptops and all which will cost you at least 40-50 thousand if you want to do Photoshop and editing on it but fee remission is there to protect us if your family income is less than 5 lakh rupees, you can avail the fee remission and if you belong to Scheduled castes or Scheduled tribes, you don't have to worry about fees, you are fully remitted of tuition fees. 
I personally belong to the general category and most of the scholarships are either given to the reserved category students or to the girl students so I personally feel bad due to the fee hike policy of the government."
Student (Anonymous),Uttarakhand Ayurved University,"B.A.M.S,",7.8,Review of Uttrakhand Ayurved University,"First of all, I chose this course because of its rising demand and also because I have a keen interest in learning about Ayurveda, its remedies, and its treatment. 
In teaching the faculty is good overall. But in some departments, the faculty members are very few. 
The faculty member is well qualified. They all are mds from different regions of India. Many of them are from BHU too. 
The term exams are conducted in every 6 months(total 3 times) as the 1st prof. is of one and a half years now. And the periodic test is conducted 3 times in every 6 months(Total 9 times) and the Last Final exam is conducted at the end of the prof."

Prakhar Srivastava,Deshbandhu College,"B.Sc, Computer Science",9.0,Deshbandhu Mania,I choose this course because I have an interest in computers. I wanted to do MCA in the future so I opted in. The teachers at our college are very good. They are always ready for their help. They teach us so well that we just need to revise their notes in exams and that's enough to score good marks. Teachers are well qualified. Computer teachers have done highest qualification as MCA and they have done diploma. Term exams were soon within the short time period in our batch 2021 because of Corona. Our admission process took too much time but it was good in 2nd year. The exam was good in the way that our teachers taught and gave in their notes that only came. So it helped us a lot.

Rishul soni,Institute of Engineering and Rural Technology - [IERT],"B.Tech, Industrial & Production Engineering",5.5,"Average placements, not much better campus life but competitive environment","There is a lack of social events in the college and if there is then the whole responsibility of the funding and conducting the process is given to some group of selected students. The sports facility is very poor and the college ground is not big enough to involve any sports. Although there is our yearly technical festival called ""technovation"" and ""aikyam"" as a farewell. The fresher's auditions will also be conducted for new admission to showcase they're taken on stage."

Suthar Masum Sureshbhai,L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Mechanical Engineering",7.3,Dream college for those who want to learn while enjoying life,"After the 6th-semester students become eligible for placement. The average package offered for a mechanical engineer is around 5 to 6 lakhs.
You can see companies involved on the website of ld college of engineering.
Some of them are Accenture, Adani, Suzuki, torrent power, tata motors, reliance private ltd, and many more. Every year around 75 to 80 % of students get placed according to their skills."
Sanjeev Kumar,Kirori Mal College - [KMC],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Zoology",9.3,My college lifee,"The annual fest of the zoology department is ecdysis it was conducted by the zoological society biocenosis.
The fest is conducted in March or April. It was a yearly fest other fests and events are also conducted from time to time.
The availability of books is very good in the library but u can't get general.
The sports and extra curricular activities are very also good but I don't know more about them because I was less into sports."
Rishabh,University Institute of Engineering and Technology - [UIET],"B.Tech, Computer Science",6.3,"UIET, A PLACE TO MAKE MEMORIES, AND BE READY FOR THE LIFE.","Well this is something, which really needs to be worked upon, as campus placements are very less for tech field, and almost zero for core branches. Here companies do visit, but at a very bad rate. On campus placements do happen, but the amount is not very fair. The average package is of about 3 to 4 lpa. Something which is good here is that, students take off campus jobs from here, and this college also provides, quite a number of good ranks of gate exam from core branches. Yes, if you study here, and have a dream of having job, then you need to work on your skills, so that you can grab off campus jobs. In recent years, companies like infoysis, tca, etc have visited here, and provided employment to students. But it's not constant. 
Nearly 50-60 percent of students from cse and it get placed from here, but highest package won't go above 6 lpa on campus. I do look forward for an off campus job, with decent salary from here."
Preetish shende,CMR Institute of Management Studies (Autonomous) - [CMRIMS],"BCA, General",8.7,Better carrier ..,"The placement  of collage is very  good atleast 80 % of students get placement in our collage the faculty provide us knowledge  how to give interview.

Dennis,Kristu Jayanti College - [KJC],"B.Com {Hons.}, General",8.3,Life at KJC,"Life on the campus is filled with new things and every day you learn something new right from meeting a new person and being friends to learning a new skill. Since the college has a diverse nature of students, there is a very good chance you'd meet someone from a different state and learn new things about that place. The classrooms are very clean and the college has also been awarded the clean and green campus award by the Karnataka Govt. The sports department is also well taken care of and it ensures that everyone gets a chance to do something they love at sports. It is competitive but also it helps us learn new skills for the sport we like."
Shivam kumar,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.0,My university my life my choices,My course is computer science and Engineering. I chose this course because it will provide me very vast scope and opportunities. The faculties are good they explain things very easily. Student ratio: 65-70 students per class. Teachers are well qualified here and their teaching methods are good not but yes most of them teach well. Exams will be there every 2 and a half weeks. Examinations are not too tough but yes you should have to learn the chapters wisely so that you can get good marks.
Prateek Malav,IIT Jodhpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITJ],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.8,Excellent facilities and Learning Culture at IIT Jodhpur,I choose this course because I was interested in that field and also keen to learn new things.

Saksham Dubey,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0,A Deep Dive in DTU,"Talking about the fest, we have one of the most famous fests of delhi-ncr, it's Engifest. There is no hustle in getting sponsors. It was backboned by our society, the Cultural council. It is responsible for every fest and program held at DTU. And it does its job quite well. For books, DTU has a big library with estimated 300k books and a lot more in e-book form. We are allowed to issue a set of 6 books for the whole semester. And we can issue some books for just a week other than those 6. Of course, being late invites penalties. Our classrooms are equipped with a whiteboard, markers brought by teachers and a duster is present all the time. We also have a projector in our class. It does not work in a few rooms. For sports, DTU has given a large piece of land to sports grounds. We have all types of sports grounds except for the swimming pool. I'm not a lot into sports so I cant tell you a lot about them. We hve website resources. the tech that has everything we need for our syllabus."
Mayank gour,SAGE University,,8.0,Mayank's review,The fees are good compared to other colleges. The fee of my course is 70000/ yr which can be more for lower class students but the college also provides scholarship benefits to all the students who have less income. Also college provides the govt post matric scholarship for the students of SC ST and OBC. Although the fees must be less as compared to the current fee structure. The overall fee structure is good for other courses also. although it is quite good for other colleges for the same course.
Akash Bihari Parida,Gandhi Institute for Technology - [GIFT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.5,College placement percentage is excellent,"No, it's simple in my childhood I'm so curious about electronic instruments so I just want to know detailed information about these instruments and their applications in our daily life so I choose this branch. Faculty members are excellent I think non of the faculty members are less than five your experience so they are fully experienced and so confident in their lectures. The student ratio is around 38 in our branch. Faculty members are having Ph.D. in their respective subjects. Their teaching method is very attractive. If a student was unable to understand her lectures then they tried to clear his doubt whenever he understand the concept. No doubt all our facility members are excellent. There are only two-term exams and all exams are conducted in a good way there is no cheating and disturbance are not accepted. So to pass the above exam you have to study hard."

SAMANVAYA JAIN,Christ (Deemed to be University) Delhi NCR,"BBA, General",6.7,Christ University Delhi ncr honest review,"All the faculty P.hd, the ratio is a good student to faculty, they are informative also just that college structure is rigid, the method I did not find that great it would have been better, thing students also try to cheat the system, if they change their approach."
Dhairya Gupta,SS Jain Subodh PG College,"BCA, General",7.3,"Absolute reality,","The annual fest is termed as the freshers and farewell in the college and happens in the month of April, the tech fest i.e technique happened last month and was phenomenal we had a lot of fun with entries from 18+ colleges. There are two libraries, central and department, both are well equipped and decent but the availability of books depends on the duration, during exams it's hard to issue the books. The classrooms are kind of average not that good but work. I'm not into sports personally but the college has a well-maintained ground with a decent gym as well. Unfortunately, there aren't any clubs in the college yet. but we freshers are trying to get them up by this year."
Aditya Singh,ABES Institute of Technology - [ABESIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",2.8,"Life @ABESIT, but are there really any pros about this college?","The college is affiliated with AKTU so there isn't much to expect from the curriculum instead it is best to follow industry trends and start preparing for placements as early as possible because college won't be helping you in placements. Number of exams is okayish considering the course. And faculty is not that good and they'll focus on you passing the exams rather than learning things. Finally, they expect you to build projects on techs that hadn't been taught in the whole course."
Ahana Chakraborty,Adamas University,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Biochemistry",7.8,Exploring college life,"Life on the campus is vibrant. We have green fields, a basketball ground, a football and a cricket ground too. 
A cafeteria is also present where students can have their snacks and coffee along with gossip.
The food court provides lunch to day scholars too."
Rahul,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Computer Engineering",8.3,Facing truths,To be very honest as I'm in 1st-year 1st sem. our faculties members are not good as I supposed that they all are in a very hurry. They want to finish the syllabus as soon as possible may be the reason behind this is bcoz of COVID. The college wants its curriculum on its track But yeah some teachers are good in DTU faculty: the student ratio is very poor on average it is 1:37..which is very poor in comparison to other engineering colleges exams are conducted on time but this year they are very strict end sem and mid sem ends in just 5 days. It  becomes very hectic
kartik,Anuradha Engineering College - [AEC],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",6.7,all about aec,"from the 7th semester, students are eligible for campus placement, no big companies come to college and the average package is 2.5 lakh per annum.
25% of students getting placed on campus, there are a lot of companies visiting college but most are related to the mechanical or electrical field."
Aviral Awasthi,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Automotive Engineering",7.8,Review about college life in dtu,"I choose this course as I want to pursue my engineering in mechanical only and also my percentile was not very much high and only left with these choices. faculty to student ratio is 1:73 but there are many PhD scholars who help us in improving our subject. also don't expect very much from the faculty as it is a government college. exams are easily cracked and most of the questions come from the teacher notes only and only 2 exams are held in one semester.
I must say exams are not very difficult to pass and even if you study 1 week before or in some subject one night before you can achieve good grades"
Chaitanya Syamala,BV Raju Institute of Technology - [BVRIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.6,Good and Enjoyable Life,"The course curriculum is taken from some of the top institutions like iit's, nit's and it is very good.
I have chosen computer science and engineering because I was good at maths. For every 20 students, we have a special faculty member like a counsellor who helps you to grow better. The faculty members are very and many of them have received PhDs and some the pursuing We get a lot of help from the faculty members. We have semester exams at the time of Dec and June the exam difficulty was moderate 
around 70+% will pass every semester"
Devansh Singh,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",7.7,All rounder Dtu,"I chose B.tech in Mechanical engineering because from starting I have interest in Robotics and I want to pursue higher studies in Mechatronics engineering. The faculty-student ratio is approximately 40:1 and it is much better than most colleges in India. Faculty are highly qualified all of them are PhD holders and yes last year 16 professors from our institute were listed in the top professor list by Stanford University.
Term exams ended just recently, the only thing to say for good marks you have to start studying at least 15 days before it's not like you will score well studying last night."

With over 30+ societies it offers one the scope, space and opportunity to follow any hobby, which one would have suppressed with their JEE preparation. From Technical to non-tech to arts, the societies offer you everything you could ever dream of, pros of having a large number of students.

Sanidhya,IILM University,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.7,Scrutinizing MY college,"Since I am a prodigy of the ICSE/ISC curriculum of the Indian study system, so, since class 9th I had JAVA programming language in my computer science syllabus which was continued till class 12th.

Almost all the teachers are P.hd. holders in their working fields. Coming from IITs, they hold a robust grip over the subject of their interest and teaching.

All the faculty members have proficient skills and thorough knowledge of their subjects and hold a PhD degree. The teaching method is also up to the mark. It depends from teacher to teacher.
The syllabus is vast as per the new education policy but Can be covered with dedication within a month. Exams constitute subjective and lengthy questions so that there is no scope for cheating. Exams are conducted periodically after every 4 months for each semester along with preparatory leaves which is sufficient for a student to cover the syllabus."

Mostly they have faculty who have done MTech or PHD from IITs but not bachelor's, and some faculty are from international colleges also. The exams happen 3 times a semester. 1st after 1.5 months of start of semester, 2nd after 2.5 and 3rd after 3.5. the time after the start of the semester is the peaceful one other than its all hustle day and night. Too much academic pressure."

Krish,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Computer Engineering",6.7,Detailed review about DTU,"Students get full time placement opportunities in fourth year. However internship opportunities come in the second and third year. Every big mnc like google,amazon, microsoft ,flipkart,apple come here for recruitment. Over 400 companies come for recruitment.
In 2022 the average placement was about 16 lpa for entire college and 25 lpa in cse branch. Record placements were seen in  2022. Number of offers were close to 2400 approx and almost all the students(about 90percent) were placed who appeared for placements in 2022. 
Highest international package was about 1.15 crore which was offered to 15 students form amazon dublin. Highest domestic package was 65 lpa given by apple. 

My plan is to get a tech( full stack devloper) job with a decent package in any of these companies.

However placement opportunities are really great, i feel that due to huge competition in dtu beacuse of large student strength, it becomes really competitive to get that dream package of above 40 lpa."

The course curriculum is quite relaxed and to the point. In IIIT Gwalior, we don't have common subjects in the first year. They directly start with advantageous core subjects. DSA starts in the second semester itself. Faculty all have PhDs and are qualified. They teach using lecture slides and solving questions on the board. The quality of faculty and teaching method is on par with other colleges. The student ratio depends on batch, it's somewhere between 60-120.
Exams happen exactly as per the schedule and are fairly easy to pass. Studying one night before the exam is enough to pass, given that the student has attended some of the classes. There is a 75% attendance criteria that Some lectures strictly follow."

faculty: student ratio is very low. There are generally more than 100 students in a usual class.
Faculty members are highly qualified and have done their Ph.D. and post Docs from renowned Indian and international universities. The teaching method is basically going through slides in subjects other than maths and for maths, they write on the projectors and boards.
There is 1 Minor and 1 Major evaluation. In some semesters, there can be 2 minors and 1 major, it is announced beforehand. Exams are very difficult to score and it is quite hard to maintain a decent GPA here."

Amitabh,Delhi Technical Campus - [DTC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.5,Delhi Technical Campus,"think the college is good. I mean students are supposed to attend college for knowledge. It’s proper education what is needed instead of how big is campus ( we are not going to play golf in that) moreover the answers i read are mostly from juniors who are either just freshers or 1st year students who are still not out of their school life comfort zone.

Dude it’s engineering college one of the hardest course. Go study and secure marks i have seen the placement and it is quite good unless and until you are carrying a backlog.

Maybe students don’t like the attendance criteria and the fact of PTM. And that is the reason for the negative comments i can see here. Some are talking about travel time because they commute from delhi and if that is the reason go get a PG or hostel.

One can even study in the light of lamp then why not face a little difficulty which too is in favour of students only.

First, after 1 month after the start of the semester mini test contains 10 marks for each subject. then after 2.5 months of the semester, the mid-term exam contains 20 marks and at last, after the 3.5-month end, ter exams contain 60 marks exam and the remaining 10 marks for attendance/assignment.
College exams are not much difficult to pass just regular study or even properly attended professor lectures is enough to get a decent cgpa at the semester's end."

Every 6 months we have semester exams and it was kind of difficult to pass.
Amitabh,Delhi Technical Campus - [DTC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.5,Delhi Technical Campus,"think the college is good. I mean students are supposed to attend college for knowledge. It’s proper education what is needed instead of how big is campus ( we are not going to play golf in that) moreover the answers i read are mostly from juniors who are either just freshers or 1st year students who are still not out of their school life comfort zone.

Dude it’s engineering college one of the hardest course. Go study and secure marks i have seen the placement and it is quite good unless and until you are carrying a backlog.

Maybe students don’t like the attendance criteria and the fact of PTM. And that is the reason for the negative comments i can see here. Some are talking about travel time because they commute from delhi and if that is the reason go get a PG or hostel.

One can even study in the light of lamp then why not face a little difficulty which too is in favour of students only.

All i can see are excuses of some freshers to defame a well reputed college"

In my college, the ratio is about 1:50 as there are many PhD students who also help you a lot in achieving your goals and setting a vision in life. Seniors guide you to the best of their knowledge. Qualification of the teachers is at such a level that one cannot believe that they have rejected a higher pay due to their busy work schedule and accepted the offer by my college. Mid Term and end term and the 2 exams that are conducted in a particular semester and the ease of the exam depends upon the students if attending each and every class then the examination is not a problem but if not attended classes the student can still cope up if she/he manages to study one week before the exam. For the mid-term 1 week beforehand and the end term 1 month beforehand preparation is more than sufficient."
