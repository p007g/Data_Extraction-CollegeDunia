Our college environment is too healthy for study, 9 faculties are in our botany dept. out of the 2 are demonstrated. One lab assistant, and other teaching staffs the ratio of faculty: students are 1:5, teaching staffs are ph.D qualified & teaching quality is too friendly & well explained, easy to understand.

Kushagra Srivastava,Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology - [GCET],"B.Tech, Information Technology",5.3,,"My first choice was CSE but didn't get a Fee Waiver seat there and hence chose IT. At that time on the hindsight, I was worried about this decision of mine but now when I look back I feel it was a very good decision and both the courses are 99% similar. Faculty student ratio is pretty good. There were around 10-15 faculties for IT branch with 120 students. Many faculties were common for CSE and IT. Most of the faculties had masters degree with few having doctorate as well. Faculties were educated enough but barring one or two, rest of them had a traditional teaching style of forcing the students to memorize everything. Anyway in an engineering college, what u do outside of course curriculum matters more.
Term exams were very timely. And in my experience they were very easy to pass. Marks were given based on handwriting and how much pages u filled. No one really cared about the quality of answers."

There are various schools of Engineering like School of Mechanical, Civil, Electronics, Electrical etc..
In the first year, all students have the same subjects related to what they learned in class 12th but in more detail.

The faculties are excellent and very supportive.
Even in these tough times they kept us motivated for our studies and left no stone unturned.
All of the faculties were highly qualified and the majority of them did their M Tech and Ph.D. from IITs.

The exam culture is very strict at KiiT as it is governed by a central body known as the Office of the Controller of Examination.
You will get an academic calendar at the starting of the year and it is followed"

You learn about electronics, a few electrical and computer science (data structure, foc and more) based concepts. The best part is the communication. I dont think any other stream gives you this diversified yet trivial knowledge of all the fields. That's the reason I chose ECE. It is mandatory to maintain a good student to faculty ratio and it varies between college to college. Our college has a student to faculty ratio of nearly 1:29. Our college has faculties and professors from all around the world. Most of them hold a Post Doctorate Degree rest of them are involved in research works.

There are lots of books which are truly helpful. There was cricket ground before but now a new building is being raised there. So that is a lack. An indoor stadium named Maruti stadium is also available for indoor games. It has air-conditioned auditoriums. Many events and club activities come up and the campus environment is also good, so campus life is pretty good."
Ashneet kaur,Jagannath International Management School - [JIMS] Kalkaji,,9.5,Perfect JIMS,I chose BBA because my interest areas are marketing and finance.

Internal and externals are 2 types of examinations held. Internals are held by the college for 25 marks where 15 marks are for written tests and rest 10 marks are for assignments and your interaction in class. Externals are conducted by the university itself by the end of each semester and are of 75 marks.
Rhea Prabhakaran,SIES School of Business Studies - [SIES SBS],"PGDM, General",4.3,"Good Curriculum, High Fees, No Amenities, Mediocre to Poor Placement (use references instead)","In terms of the curriculum, PGDM is the best compared to MMS. Much wider portion, very knowledgeable faculty, and all are very helpful and easily approachable. No electives are available even though it is mentioned on the site. Also SIES SBS is still in process of being approved by AICTE so there is no organization that can intervene during problems.

Students are very diverse from all backgrounds. 50% are South Indians and the rest of the majority are Maharashtrians along with other folks, friendly (No impact on student interaction).

In terms of teaching quality, 50% Faculty is amazing, 50% are either mediocre or poor. Not open to constructive feedback.
Best faculty are from Marketing and HR. Marketing is given most importance in extra-curricular; faculty encourages students to join marketing as placement is highest and easier (But only choose as per your interest).

Exam was online and written, no camera or supervision. Lengthy paper & 2 hours. Easy to pass but not easy to get highest score."

But there were eligibility criteria where a student must obtain 8 and above CGPA with no backlogs to move to the willing stream of his/hers. With the help of faculty and other college authorities, I could land in my dream stream CSE.

Faculties are very friendly and teach us the topics any number of times without any hesitation. They are the major pillars of our college and they are the reason behind the success of the college.

The faculty of KIET college is very kind-hearted and they love their students very much. They always stand for their students and to solve their problems. the relation of faculty and students looks like they are family members and know everything about us. and always ready to solve our issues and any kind of problems.

In the subsequent years the quality of teaching improves drastically as the students take up the courses in their respective departments.

Student (Anonymous),KIET Group of Institutions - [KIET],"B.Tech, Computer Science",10.0,Dream college KIET,"I chose the computer science course because I am very much enthusiastic about technology and have a dream to do something in the field of technology.

Talking about faculty :
The quality of faculty is awesome 95% of faculties are done Ph.D. degree rest are opting for a Ph.D. degree.
each faculty gets only two sections which is a very good thing in the college.

Term exam is very helpful in checking the knowledge what we get in the weeks, there is 4 5 test in one semsters and these are very helpful and beneficial in order to see the university exam. These exams help you to give the idea of the difficulty level of the university exam.

Talking about the level of difficulty I think that level was a little bit higher than the university exam and it is good for us that level is higher than the university exam."
Student (Anonymous),Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University - [TMBU],,5.8,Review-Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University,"This is under UGC and it takes many tests and practical exams to check the progress of students. In terms of rules and law of college, TMBU is very strict in studies and other campus rules like there is a fine for littering on the campus. faculties of this college are highly educated. Many of them hold Ph.D. degrees for their respective subjects. They are very well experienced and the style of teaching is unique. But they still use blackboard for teaching. faculties here are very supportive and helpful. The ratio of faculty to students is 1:45-50 which is good for a student. Honestly, they never conduct session exams on time, there is always a delay in final semester exams. The difficulty of exams depends on the faculty, many times it's not that hard to pass. If you prepare a little you can pass easily."

It is a combination of more than 3 branches that is CE, IT, and EC. Faculties are always available 24X7 for students for any kind of help. Faculties are highly qualified and have very good experience of around 8 years. Internal exams are scheduled when the topic is over or the Unit is finished and every 1 and half month mid sem exams are being conducted by the college."

The fests of other departments are also held in Feb and March. There is a library in the college through which you can issue the books but it needs to be improved as some books are old editioned books. There are various sports in the college like hockey, cricket, volleyball, basketball, Kabaddi, etc., and the hockey ground is well maintained and the hockey team of our college is no. 1 in DU. There are many cells and societies in the college."

Student (Anonymous),IIT Kharagpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITKGP],,9.4,KGP is best Institute for Education and Enjoying Life .,"I chose this course because I find this course very interesting and related to daily life activities.
The faculty-student ratio of IIT KGP is very well relative to other IIT's which is 1:19. The students are able to interact with faculties very easily.
The faculties of this institute have a high qualification as most of them are IITians, well-renowned Scientists, Ph.D. ones, etc.
Allocations of the faculty members are well planned in this institute and the Teaching process of them is a bit quite friendly.
They treat students like their friends and classes are held in a very fun manner. Students tell that faculties are very good in terms of explaining the topics and clearing our doubts.
The exams are held continuously like mid-term and end-term examinations. Assignments are held every week for testing students' skills.
The level of exams is quite tougher which we are supposed to give. I myself found it harder to score full marks in exams."
Harshit,Sri Aurobindo College,,7.6,College review,"The campus life is really awesome. I mean you get to stay in-between nature and many shopping complexes around and very easy access to metro and bus stations. Food shops and cafes are all nearby. Our college has conducted many fests and events in the past many years. So our college's main fest/event name is MEHAK. That was literally the best event and there were so many students who had participated in it. All fests/events took place in the month of April. Talking about the college library. So it is really well maintained I must say. As such we do not face any unavailability or shortage of books. When it comes to amenities that we get to experience in our classrooms. So I would say those are on an average scale. But we do not have any issues with that. This means, we get to experience and use all the basic things in good condition. The infrastructure of our college is not that good as I was expecting when I entered the college for the first time. But, yes all infrastructure in DU is on an average scale"

Apart from that college has several clubs as per students' interests like marketing, finance, HR, data science, etc."
Ashlesh,IIT Kanpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITK],"M.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",9.0,,This is the best part of all. You cannot expect a better campus than this. Other IITs also got a nice infrastructure but as they are between the metropolitan cities they lack the space to expand. But IITK is 15 kms from Kanpur City and they have ample amount of space available. The campus is a lush green with nice architectural buildings open and green spaces. A lot of peacocks can be seen here and there.
Yash garg,KR Mangalam University,,10.0,First come first serve,"Because I love to do marketing and explore new innovative ideas to make it more creative for me. In this campus, all the facilities members are very well trained as per their posts and their teaching method is superb because after each and every concept they'll give a brief example so the student can understand it properly. 2 hours will be given to us for our exams the pattern of the exam is from easy to difficult so I must say if we have studied it properly then it will be easy for each one of us to crack it and succeed with a very good percentage."
