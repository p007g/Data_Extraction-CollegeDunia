Student (Anonymous),Institute of Engineering and Management - [IEM],"B.Tech {Lateral}, Information Technology",10.0,College Review,"B.Tech(Information Technology) is the highest demanding course at the current time. A lot of students are trying their best to get into a good college and pursue IT and CSE courses. IEM is one of the best colleges in west Bengal. The teachers are great. They help in every aspect, especially the mentor. Mentors are the best part of IEM. Mentors also help you with other issues(other than college related). The student-to-teacher ratio is great. We have a lot of teachers. All are experts in their fields. Every subject is divided into modules and for each module, different teachers are specialized in that field. The exams are timely and the questions are of average level. If you follow your teachers and attend their classes then it shouldn't be hard to pass with a good score."

 The teachers and professors along with the office staff are very helpful. HODs (Heads of departments) in all departments hold a Ph.D. (Doctorate) in their respective fields. They are highly enthusiastic and approachable with my personal favorite being the CSE HOD and the Mathematics HOD. 2 very great personalities. There are a minimum of 5 lecturers in each branch excluding the HOD. (5+1). We also have a strength of about 50 students per class and a minimum of 4 classes per course. The professors opt for a hands-on teaching method which includes group discussions, PPT presentations, etc. that help the students involve and interact with the staff and their fellow students. This gives students a new way of learning and understanding subjects."
