Meraj anwar,Shershah College of Engineering - [SCE],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.5,Most affordable college in the india,"I choose this course because I'm not able to pay high money for a b.tech and this college is also in my home town so it is a good thing for me 
And this is also a government college so you get more benefits as well 

Faculty: in this college, all faculty have an m.tech with PhD degree and they qualified BPSC assistant professor exam then they get jobs in this college so dont worry about the faculty because they are well educated.
Every year 360 students take admitted in this college there are 6 branches present in this college 
Review for qualification of faculty I give 10 out of 10 
For teaching method, i give 7 out of 10 
Because all you know is that college faculty does not cover your whole syllabus

Yeah, the exam happened on time and little bit tough exam because college is too strict."

Ravi Sharma,Ramjas College,"B.Sc, Physical Sciences",5.6,A nice struggling life,"In physical science, we get to study all three core subjects of science and It has a more diverse curriculum so we get the opportunity to work in any of the three fields. 
Our college has a very good student-to-teacher ratio as we have around 1 professor of each subject per 30-35 students in our course. All the professors are well qualified and hold PHD degrees but hardly half of them genuinely take interest in helping students rest of them just care about completing the course.
Since our batch started late in the initial three semesters, exams were held every 4 months but it's now being held in the regular time period which is 6 months. And the difficulty of university exams is quite okay and for physical science, It's very easily to pass the exam but very tough to score more cgpa."

The library is good enough and the infrastructure is also great and better than many colleges and there we can find all the relevant books and journals.
 Although classrooms are also below average, benches and fans were not in proper condition, not for all classrooms but the majority of them.
Although I don't involve more in sports I have a good zone in sports, the ground is also very enough for every sport. 
Extracurricular activities are also good, for example, I also joined abhivyakti society for debate, and find it a very good and skilful society. 
=> There is no such huge social group, clubs or website for students run by students but lots of political organisations like abvp, dusu, etc our college is enough politically active and improving day by day."

But time is never on your side when you have assignments. You are just a number that's passing by. Group assignments: there are leeches out there, who will want to be in your group and then do nothing. If you go out with friends and you have a test or exam coming soon, study, because those friends that you went out with are probably pulling all-nighters as the test/exam day comes closer.

As the strength of the students is around 7-8 k, the strength of the faculties is also Good enough, around 3-4k. And every one of them is well qualified. Although we engineers don't need that type of class study, we just study 2-4 nights before the exams and also we score well. Well yeah, it's possible because of the quality of education, faculties are providing us in the class. We just have to see once the terms and the score are in our hands. Per semester is of 14 weeks, and after 7 weeks you have to give the mid-term, which is tbh not that tough. If u are just regular in the class and just revise the course once before the exam, it'll be much easier to score well. And after another 7 weeks, there will be the end term, the final exam, which is a bit tough than the midterm exam."

The package they offer is around 4 lakhs which is not much, and only a limited number of companies come to the campus for recruitment. Most of the batch graduates are without any placement offers.
Students who wish to pursue a job have to find opportunities or internships on their own. Sometimes faculties also help students to get a job. As per my observation, most of the students opt for higher education after graduation.
However, I do believe that the absence of campus placements doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of education or employability of the students. It's just that students have to rely on their efforts to secure job opportunities."

Choosing this course increases my options for a career in bachelor of commerce as well as in law with integrated options as well.
Faculty: Student ratio in UILS is nominal with ample Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors. With 180 seats per course divided among 3 sections each, available professors are enough for the same. 
Faculty's qualification is Phd for professors with amazing work profiles as can be seen in their CVs provided on University's website. 
The teaching method is subjective with every subject. Like subjects of law are taught in a pretty well way accompanied by ample competitions like a moot court, ADRs, Judgement Writing, quizzes etc. contrary to theoretical subjects which are boring.
 Mid sems being objective and Final exams being subjective are conducted every semester with a moderate level of difficulty requiring a lot of content to score well."

Student (Anonymous),Shoolini University,"B.Tech, Cyber Security",10.0,Review of my college Shoolini,"At Shoolini University, our goal is to provide valuable opportunities to students that enrich their portfolios and build a professional network. These include the foundational skills essential to map out their career trajectory and future goals in any field or the job market.
Earlier, career preparedness was all about facing a certain level of academic rigour and gaining important life skills. Now, the value of experiential learning has increased manifold. It complements the degree and helps students get hands-on experience and insights into how the industry works.
This is where internships and job shadowing opportunities can play an important role. We, at Shoolini, give our students multiple options to pursue internships with top-notch companies and also internally. Most of these internships offer stipends/monetary benefits to students."

But when we see it in numbers, It feels very high. When this continues, people will feel extreme difficulties affording the fees in the next 10 years. Being Lower middle class financially, It's difficult for us too.
There are scholarships and fee waivers but most people won't be able to avail of them. The tuition fee waiver is only for those belongings to SC/ST. KVPY provides a monthly stipend for its scholars which is around 5-7000 per month but I don't think there are any KVPY scholars in my class. There is another scholarship scheme by DST called INSPIRE that provides 5000 per month to very few students. The cutoff for INSPIRE goes around 96-97% for the CBSE board and similar for other boards. Also, you won't be eligible for INSPIRE if you are a dropper. Of the 200 students in my class, there are around 10-11 INSPIRE scholars. 
There is no Fee waiver for economically weak people."
