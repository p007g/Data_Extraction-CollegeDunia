Ghandhy Government Engineering College,"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.4,All round development,"Semester 7 students are eligible to apply for placements. There is one placement rule. If you are placed through college then you cannot apply for other companies through campus placement. Companies like Reliance Industries, Torrent, Adani, L&T, and TCS visit here. Also, the TCS training camp is held for 3rd-year students too. A lot of expert talk is held. For NCC cadets in Electrical engineering, there is a huge benefit. They get recruited in the Navy for 12lpa. There are students who serve in BSF too. The highest package is for Engg Officers in Army, Navy, and Air Force i.e 12lpa. For civilians, Reliance Industries offers 7.5 CTC. But still, the percentage of students getting placed is low. In my Dept this year only 10-11 students are placed 3 in reliance industries, 3 in Adani, 2 in E info chips, and 2 in TCS out of 75 total strength. I am placed in Reliance Industries so I will continue in New Energy Plant. And I am a passionate musician my voice has been on the air on radio stations in Surat. Also done playback."

The faculty is qualified enough, many of the professors are Ph.D. holders and some of them are currently pursuing a Ph.D. or research in some or the other institutes. The teaching method of the faculties is average. Neither too good nor too bad. If you're a person who loves attending classes then you'd find it pretty interesting. The final term exams are conducted by the university this college is affiliated with (AKTU). They are held a bit late every time due to the university schedules. And on average, it is not that difficult to pass them."

Teachers are pretty well qualified, cooperative and have good teaching methods
But some teachers are freshers so they don't have that much experience in teaching which causes issues sometimes.

Student (Anonymous),Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.7,Not good but not bad. If possible try to go for vit Vellore rather than vit Chennai.,"I choose the CSE course because it's booming right now and I think the future is software and of course good salary everyone chose CSE as their first preference and I just went with the flow.
Above avg faculty and as you know there are always who are bad btw you can choose the faculty you want for every semester based on the previous semester's gpa and attendance. in vit the student ratio is always high as everyone knows.
The teaching methods are ok I think. They won't teach you everything you have to learn by yourself that's what college is. No one tells you this or not you have to take care of yourself.
Here vit term completes very quickly like btw 4 or 5 months a semester will complete and a lot of syllabi will be covered and even if you listen to your classes or not at the end everyone relies on youtube.  
If you work even a little bit like before the exam 1 week you can pass no problem but for the final exams, you have to work hard a little if you have a good cgpa."

There are two groups in each branch, i.e, about 60 students and there are two professors for each group for a particular subject. Also, both the groups are further divided into three sub-groups, i.e, a total of six sub-groups for labs, and a professor is assigned to each sub-group.
All the professors are not too good, not too bad just like the normal stereotypical image of a professor in an engineering college. 
The college conducts mid-term and end-term examinations in a semester. Also, quizzes and lab assignments are also conducted. We have midterms after two and a half months after the start of the semester and end terms after the same amount of time.

The faculty: student ratio is an essential factor to consider while choosing a course or university. A low faculty: student ratio means that students can receive more personalized attention from the faculty, which can result in a better learning experience. On the other hand, a high faculty: student ratio can lead to less individual attention and more generalized teaching.
All faculty have a master's in qualifications and well experience in the teaching field. 
The term exams should be conducted promptly to ensure that students have enough time to prepare for them. The difficulty level of the exams should be appropriate to ensure that students are challenged but not overwhelmed. The passing criteria should also be reasonable to ensure that students can progress through the course without undue stress."
