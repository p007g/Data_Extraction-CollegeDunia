Hemlata Joshi,ICFAI Business School - [IBS],,8.8,IBS : A Review,"The admissions for the MBA course is merit based. For the admission the candidates must have a valid CAT/GMAT/XAT score. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of this score, and then called in for a GD/PI. The final selection is based on the performance of the candidate in GD/PI. My reason for opting ICFAI was its high ranking. It has ranked 26 by NIRF and 8 for Private MBA by Outlook. The academics at the institution are in par with that offered at IIMs and NITs."

Akash,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.6,My Opinion on IIIT Pune,"One of the main reasons was that it was a central government college in Pune. If I had gone through more rounds, I would have gone to other colleges, but I needed a CSE so IåÊchose this college. Placements for B. Tech students are excellent, which is another reason to choose this college. In terms of drawbacks, we don't have a permanent campusåÊandåÊhostel, they areåÊstill under construction. Furthermore, COEP, one of the best colleges in Maharashtra, is mentoring the college, which is a plus. The admissions process is the same as that of any other reputable IITs or NITs.

Admission Date will be announced by JoSAA and physical reporting is not required as of now."

Student (Anonymous),Father Agnel Technical College,"Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",10.0,Best College for Diploma in Navi Mumbai,"I choose this curriculum because I loved the fundamentals of mechanical engineering. I really enjoyed the subjects that were involved in this course. The faculty in Agnel polytechnic are very experienced in teaching. There is about 20 student to one faculty ratios and they really helped us in our engineering studies. Most of the teachers are M-tech with 20+ years of teaching experience. While the majority are helpful and supportive there are one or two who are really not that supportive and I do not recommend them. Most of them use projectors to teach and also make good use of technology such as microphone speakers to improve teaching quality. The exams are held at pretty good time intervals. Just as with the school Formative assessment timings so catching up was not an issue. Since the faculty was great, the subjects were passed relatively easily and we had no problems in our time. Every 2 months there would be a 20 marks unit test followed by a semester exam. Pretty good experience"

Jyoti prasad,Dibrugarh University,"PG Certificate, Women’s Studies",8.0,My beautiful experience in college during my Ug course,"We have to pay around 1100 at the time of admission every semester.  And we have to pay extra college fees, practical fees, bus fees (if anyone wants bus facility because of the distance of college and home) and hostel fees(if any student takes admission in hostels). 
Out of the above mentioned, sometimes college fees hike 500after taking admission in another semester. 
We don't get any kind of scholarship but, the college offers some scholarships for those students who were interested in civil service. For this scholarship, students have to pass an entrance, after qualifying for the exam they got the scholarship for preparation for the civil service through some coaching institutions. 
Some of our seniors got the job in my college without giving an extra interview which is conducted for the appointment of new employees or new teachers. 
Financially weak students were unable to pay all the fee amount get some relaxation in the fee."

Student (Anonymous),Patna Medical College - [PMC],"MBBS,",8.8,Excellent college with full of opportunities and satisfactions,"Getting admission in MBBS course in government medical college in India is quite difficult because you have to crack a very high competitive entrance exam that is National eligibility cum entrance test (NEET) so after getting admission in a government college you don't have to pay a huge amount. 
In my college, it is around 45000 for the whole MBBS course and fee hikes are not frequent and when it hike then we have given proper notice and it never hike in mid of the course. 
As the fee is quite affordable for every section of students so there is no need for scholarships but yes, if you want it, then you have to apply with a proper application to principal and if they found that you really need it you can get some scholarships from college and after passing out MBBS you have opportunity to do a mandatory Internship job in hospitals allotted by your college and you will get an amount of around 30000 per month as stipend but yeah there is no source of income before passing your final year exam."
Ramesh kumar,Bhagalpur College of Engineering - [BCE],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",6.3,College life,Because the cost was low since my family is poor. Good thing was that it was a government college so the fees was minimal and bad thing was that during first year the quality of education was worst as there were only a few permanent teachers so we had to study with guest lectures. The admission process was very complicated first we were called to patna for counseling there we had to choose our college on basis of our rank in entrance exams then we were told to go to our college for further process so on the day of admission we went to our college with a demand draft of admission fee form there it went smoothly. I preferred this college over others because it was cheap and it was the best college that our bihar government had to offer.

The teacher-student ratio is 12:1.Submission of projects is a must for every semester, and faculty members help students with their projects. In addition, the university conducts semester exams on time.But, the marking system of the university is without relative grading, unlike other technical institutions, making scoring a bit tough."

They stick to application-based teaching ensuring the student has a purpose or use of the concept they're being taught rather than learning it for the sake of exams. Each teacher has their own style of teaching, but they can always be altered through a feedback system (taken thrice each semester for each teacher of each subject) to help constantly improve the quality of education provided. Each class has 60-65 people and 1 teacher for each subject.

From this branch, you can explore both things in a very good manner. Also my jee main rank was 15413 so most preferable colleges was nit Jamshedpur Here there are many fests in the college like urja both in cultural and technical. 
Here faculty versus student ratio is very good. Teachers are very knowledgeable mostly they all are PhD graduates and also well versed in their subjects.  the teaching quality is good enough but not upto that level as the research level of the institute is very low. The course is relevant for me as it makes students' industry needy."
kusum,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,8.2,NIT JSR in a nutshell,"the fee hike policy is quite flexible. it depends on how frequently the central ministry commands them to hike the fees. the cost to study is affordable. the national institute of technology is one of the most affordable engineering colleges in India. 
the college provides scholarships for obcs, sc and st category students, they are given scholarships according to their income certificates. the college also has some scholarship plans like tata provides some scholarships for low-income students.
Yes, the college provides internships and job opportunities, all are paid and it also has teacher assistant programs and research opportunities for students. some companies give a huge stipend to students with good skills and many students get good stipend internships.

The more you score the higher scholarship you get, you might not even have to pay a penny if you score good enough marks. The college also provides scholarships based on JEE exam and your 12th board percentage. The college also sets up any kind of financial assistance that you need. They also provide a loan which has an approval rate of 90%. Talking about internships and placements, you get many oppurtunites in the college, but in the end you have to make it count and use the oppurtunities wisely.

Nikhil Gandhi,Jagan Institute of Management Studies - [JIMS] Rohini,,9.3,JIMS ROHINI SEC 5,"Life at the campus is good as it's a hybrid system like if we want to attend our classes online or offline that's up to us, the rest of the faculty members and my fellow mates are like a one big Jims family.

Rajeshwari Chilakala,Ashoka Women's Engineering College,"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.8,Good review is  an essential component of any study or research.,"Qspiders, Vector India, TRIEMP, Kodnest, Verzeo and many more companies help for getting placed and provide internships with good stipends.
Working on currently evolved courses and practising lab facilities are helpful for good progress and clarifying the tasks."
ARKADEEP MONDAL,Techno Main Salt Lake,"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",6.8,Overall it is well and good,"I have chosen these courses because I am passionate about machines. I this course you will learn how to operate a machine, the machine drawings, thermodynamics, heat transfer etc. Most of the teachers are with PhD degrees. Some of them are from NITs, IITsIITs and JU. There is a very good relation between teachers and students. Many of the teachers help the students a lot. The exam is taken frequently and the level of the paper is moderate."
Sakshi,Maitreyi College,"BA {Hons.}, Sociology",7.7,"The beautiful - ""Maitreyi""","I chose this course because from the 11th standard itself I have been the topper of my class in Sociology. I find it so exciting and interesting to know about the main part of our lives, the reason for our behavioral patterns, i.e. SOCIETY. Apart from this, I'm also very interested in doing social work.
Talking about the faculty of my college, is satisfying. I'll not say it is up to the mark and we don't face any problems. Sometimes we do, but then the faculty is not very irresponsible and quite satisfactory.  
The faculty is undoubtedly well-qualified and the teaching method is not the same for all teachers. It depends from teacher to teacher. Some teachers just read and explain which I find boring. Whereas some teachers take studies in a practical way, some present videos to make us understand, some keep the class more prone to the discussion, these are some teaching methods I love. 
If you study hard, nothing is difficult. I studied for my OBE (in online mode) and it went quite well."
Prerna Kumari,Netaji Subhash Engineering College - [NSEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.8,College Review,"Every course has its own importance. I want to be a software developer engineer. So, I opted for the CSE branch. The class strength is pretty good. Faculties are very helpful and supportive. They clear pin sized doubts very easily and very accurately. Online mode of studying and teaching has made it easier to access and easier to understand. We have unit tests weekly or fortnightly."
Saanjh Sengupta,Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.2,Chandigarh University - A bird with opportunities,"The main idea behind choosing CSE was its job demand. Being practical, I have to be in a position where I am successful and stable after my graduation, thus the road I chose was CSE. The student faculty ratio somewhat looks like 1 student teaching 30 students which sounds pretty normal. Moreover, in some theory classes, it is more like 1 teacher teacher, 93 students, in one go. The faculties here are either teaching and simultaneously pursuing their higher education of Masters and Post Graduations or some are at a higher post already. Talking about the teaching method, it is eco-friendly and interactive. We have ppt's, open mice sessions, and interactive hand gestures. As we use Blackboard the student interaction becomes quite easy for us in an online manner. In the end, talking about the term semesters - it isn't quite difficult to pass exams because if you know the basics you can easily pass the exams. Do note that the college is strict towards attendance so maintain it by at least 75%."

Pehu Arora,Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University For Women -[IGDTUW],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.0,Insights of IGDTUW,"Almost all the teachers from IGTUW are highly qualified, having PhDs from IITs and reputable foreign universities like Harvard too. They are pretty knowledgeable too, but I can't deny there is a poor work culture in IGDTUW. It being a govt. college, many of the teachers are reluctant to work, you need to scrape their knowledge out of them. On the other hand there are teachers who are highly devoted too and opens up a child's to endless possibilities. IGDTUW has 1 Minor (Mid-Sem exam) and 1Major (End-Sem) exam. It is difficult to score full marks, but if you work hard you can easily get a CGPA>8 (which is the eligibility criterion for some Companies at the time of placement).Many teachers do strict internal marking, but some of the are lenient too."

RAVI RANJAN,Netaji Subhash Engineering College - [NSEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",10.0,Exactly,I choose computer science bcz the scope of CSE is good in the private sector however its scope in government is null. IN NSEC teacher is a well qualified and knowledgeable ratio of students and teachers is like 30:1. The teaching styles of teachers are different which is interesting. The exam is not too difficult u can pass the exam by preparing 1 month before exam or u can pass by working on previous year questions. Many times Questions Tele from the previous year and u can score a good mark. Also what the teachers taught u in class u can get good marks. So here it's a benefit. I can rate my college 8 out of 10 and the rating of my teachers is 10 out of 10.
