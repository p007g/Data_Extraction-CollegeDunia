Himanshu,L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Computer Engineering",9.0/10,2nd Year Computer Engineering Student !!,"From the end of 3rd year, the placement environment prevails in the college.
In the computer branch, around 85% of students are placed every year.
The average package is around 3 lakh in our college.
So in terms of placements, our college is one of the best of all."
Rahul verma,Tezpur Medical College & Hospital - [TMC],"MBBS,",9.0/10,my ambition,"I choose the course because I want to be a good doctor and this college is near to my home.
All the departments have sufficient faculty who are understanding and well-qualified and take initiative in helping students. The faculty is trained and promotes learning with various methods that are interesting. Two types of the exam are conducted, one is a semester exam and another is a professional exam. Semester exam conducted by the college and professional exam by University."
Satyam Tiwari,Banaras Hindu University - [BHU],"BA {Hons.},",8.3/10,Bachelor of arts german hons,"The foreign language department of BHU is great. It offers courses in French, German, Chinese, Italian, Russian and several other languages. All the foreign language departments are under the supervision of Faculty of Arts.

Every dept. has its own faculty members of professors, scholars and clerks.

Now coming to placements, Amazon and several other companies give the opportunity to students provided you are skilled and talented enough so to they could hire you."
Student (Anonymous),Kalyani Mahavidyalaya,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Chemistry",8.0/10,My Review of Kalyani Mahavidyalaya,"Our college organizes cultural fest all around the year. Students from every department join in many programs. They recite, sing, dance or do acting. Group quiz and debate competitions were also organized. Moreover, many special days like Rabindra Jayanti, Independence day, Netaji Jayanti, Republic Day, Teacher's Day etc are organized every year.
A library is a special place for all book lovers. And we have a very good library room in our college. Thousands of books from different authors are availble here.
Our classroom is also good. We have very good campus. We have very well decorated gardens with beautiful flowers infront of our college. We have a student union group but they are very helpful."
Amit Singh,Institute of Public Health and Hygiene - [IPHH],"Diploma, Medical Laboratory Technicians",9.6/10,Best place for career groomers,"After graduation, I was confused about what to do so one of my friends has suggested this course and institute. This course help me to get a job easily. The faculty members in our college are highly qualified and knowledgeable. Teachers are supportive and cooperative. Faculty members focus more on lab learning, not on the theory which helps in understanding topics. The semester exam is not very difficult because mostly question they ask from what they have taught in the classroom."

Aryan,Kamla Nehru Institute of Physical and Social Sciences - [KNIPSS],"B.Sc (Ag.),",2.7/10,KNIPSS:- A BRIEF REVIEW,"I chose Bsc. Agriculture because I had an interest in rural and agricultural India also I want to set up a business regarding the same. 
So there are over 450+ students here. And in the 1st semester there are 12 subjects. And yes we have dedicated teacher for every subject but still there is a huge teacher student ratio like one teacher takes on around 150+ students. There are 3 section divided. And few teachers like english, Librarian hardly takes their class. 
All teachers here hold a PhD Degree but except 1 or 2 teacher no one teaches in English. Not even English teachers here speaks English properly. And Quality of teaching is not very good here. If teachers would study a topic and teach it to us...it would be very feasible for the students. But I think no teacher here in Agriculture is there to help any student.
No mid term exams were held in 2021 for bsc Ag and I think direct semester would occur. There are class test but ofcourse of no use.90% students here are of Hindi medium"
Neha Kumari,Techno Main Salt Lake,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Business Systems",8.8/10,Techno Main Salt Lake,"On comparing fees from other private colleges, Techno main is a bit affordable as the total fee is 4,94k(excluding hostel fees). And there are some scholarships also available but that was only for WB students, those who are not from West Bengal they can't. But still, it's good. Now coming to the factor of placements and internships. There are many clubs that informed us about some of the internships we can do if we have some knowledge in some specific area like in designing, web development, etc.Till now I've not tried for internships as I'm a 1st year student and I don't have much knowledge in anything. One thing that is best here that you will get to learn many things like different different workshops were held like u have interest in coding u can learn tht , if u have interest in designing, animation, etc. That things u will learn from these clubs.

Faulty members of the college hold a PhD degree and are so good with the teaching methods. It is in college I realised the value of hard work. Faculty members always gave their valuable attention to every child and helped us to grow. I wanna give 10/10 to the faculty.
Since it is a 3 year course, we have 6 semesters which implies that 1 year= 2 semesters. 1 Semester exams were scheduled in Nov- Dec, 2 semester exams took place in May-June and this continues following a strict system. For laborious student exams were not that hard you can easily score well."

Aman Kanaujiya,College of Innovative Management & Sciences - [CIMS],"BCA, General",8.6/10,My college review,"The fee for BCA  is sixty thousand per year which is not costlier other colleges demand more than sixty thousand even the University of Lucknow demands 70000 in a year and it doesn't provide any internal scholarship but you can apply for a scholarship which is given by the government.
And this college provides you with a scholarship facility but it is not from the college side it is from u p government so if you are a citizen of up then you can have the facility of scholarship for this college course fees except if your parents are in government jobs.
I didn't opt for any type of job from the college I didn't sit in a placement session because I want to go for higher education MCA that's why I leave the placement session."

Apart from this, I got a scholarship after taking LPUNEST which waived by tuition fee to half of the actual fee.
In one class there is 60-70 student but sometimes this ratio is maintained to 40-50. 
Most of the faculty will be young but they really try hard to give quality lectures instead of just completing the topic.
There are two major exams in one semester - mid-term and end term. Midterm occurs every two months and end-term will be taken after every 4-5 months. And both exams are strictly abode to schedule. Some courses are hard to pass but one can easily get notes to pass the exam."
