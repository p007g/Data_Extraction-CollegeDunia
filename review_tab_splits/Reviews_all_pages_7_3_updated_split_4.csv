Students in my college are almost 300-400 in one batch and in one branch almost 50-55 students. The faculties are good as it is a full government college so the faculties are recruited by exams and personal interviews. All the faculties have a dual degree. The internal exams are quite good and smoothly you can pass but the external exams are quite tough almost ese level questions are there."
KISHAN SINGH SHEKHAWAT,Ujjain Engineering College - [UEC],"B.Tech, Chemical Engineering",8.0,Overall better college,"My first priority is to get admission to a government college and my interest was in the chemical branch, so opted for this branch.

Suraj Kumar,Sri Aurobindo College,,7.8,Truth,I was having the history subject in my 12th class well. So I decided to take this subject again. The History department is very good in this college. Our history teacher provided notes to learn and get passed in examinations they also told about their experience of studying so that students don't get stressed. They taught us the trick of writing exams by providing important questions as well so that the student does not study he/she can take ideas and start preparing for the exam. Every year we have to give exams semester-wise we have 2 semesters in a year. The exam was a bit hard but we remembered the facts and questions which were given by our teacher.
Rahul Yadav,Dyal Singh College - [DSC],,8.0,Where dreams come true,"Unfortunately, we have not attended a single fest in college due to covid but our college has a huge library and most of all kinds of books and magazines are there.

Geetansh Rahangdale,LNCT Group of Colleges -[LNCT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",5.8,About LNCT GROUP OF COLLAGES,"In our college, the course is structured by the University which is rgpv.
The course is structured in a proper way but it would be helpful if they updated the curriculum.
The course is structured in a way that students can have a proper understanding of the subject.
The student-to-faculty ratio is approx 40:1."
SRISHTI MISHRA,Banaras Hindu University - [BHU],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Agriculture",7.4,Genuine words.,"The curriculum is very well defined and the students are provided with the full syllabus of the whole curriculum beforehand. The professors stick to those topics.
The faculty students are around 20:1 and the ratio even becomes better if we include the PhD scholars under this. We get to interact with them and they are of helpful attitude. Each and every faculty is a PhD holder in their respective streams. Teaching methods vary among them. Few of the just come and talk and we note the important points down. Many of them come with some slides and presentations and explain the topic according to the points mentioned in the slides, which I think is the best method of teaching. Exams happen in time. The syllabus and classes are planned accordingly. The difficulty level of the paper is not that much. If the student has attended all the classes, he/she can score well in the examination. In a nutshell, the questions don't come out of what is being taught in the class. This motivates us to be regular."

There are some disadvantages also that many MNCs and non-tech companies prioritise to gave placement to those students which are pursuing courses like computer science or other mathematics. So there is a lower hand for physics and chemistry students to get placement. But there is an opportunity to get into the field of research like our senior from our course is working as a researcher in BABA ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTER (BARC).

The college had offered cyber security for the 2020 batch. So I was very excited about enrolling in this college to pursue a b.tech in cyber security. The college has a lot of faculty in the computer science department, but none of them are barely qualified. They are qualified, but they don't have that much knowledge about the new technology. We have to learn new technology and new programs by ourselves. The method of teaching is also an old way of giving lessons and writing the notes and memorizing them for the exams. As the college is affiliated to KTU University, it is very hard to pass the exams as the evaluation system of KTU University is not that good."
