Every teacher has a different set of teaching methods so it depends on what method you like, I really liked how experienced professors use to take classes instead of on new teachers that focus mainly on how many pages you can write for a particular answer. But all teachers are super helpful and will help you in any matter, for me I was living in the hostel so they helped me in all ways. They have 2 internal exams and 1 final exam in each semester followed by 3 assignments and 1 seminar and practical exam.

It usually takes place in the month of December. Bhawanipur college is famous for conducting various types of programs in the college. The plus point of our college is that almost every day there is some program going on which is also good for us as we can get exposure and  learn many new things.
All the semester books are available in the college library.  The drawback of our college library is that we can only take 3 books with ourselve. We can sit in the library and study for how many hours we want to. In order to take the books with ourselves we need to issue the books from the library itself. 
The books are then need to be reissued on the required date. 
Apart from the college canteen the sports arena is the place where the students spend  most of their time.The sports arena of our college is well maintained and developed."
