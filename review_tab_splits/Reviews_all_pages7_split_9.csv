Keshav Gupta,Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology & Management - [ADGITM],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.5,Review from Genuine POV,"The course curriculum is very good, as it has a syllabus that covered all the job exams but teaching is pretty average because the department doesn't have any planned process. About the faculty-student ratio, well there are 60 students per class. Faculty are either highly qualified or properly qualified to teach (Secret: some of them graduate from here and then get placed here to teach).  Exams are held very late and results released are even later thus giving problems to final year students for off-campus placements, for passing exams you need to get through with previous year papers (at least 3-4)(Either you will pass or you will top the exam depending on luck and writing skills).
Try answering in points as long as possible with a diagram if possible. Exams aren't much difficult to pass get Akash from anywhere or previous year's papers from the library. You have to study much on your own and not rely on faculties."

Utkarsh Shukla,IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],,5.7,Review of IIT Madras online degree BSC Program in Programming and Data Science,"As it is an online degree program so there is nothing to be called as groups clubs sports or anything.
Look now the worst part of this program comes where student interactions and the feel of being in a group where you can have fun are absent. There is no such type of relevant group. although IIT made several clubs in reality, it's worth nothing this program, is very good if you are a student or professional who is doing a course outside and have a social presence outside but if you are only doing this course then you are being left alone.
In the name of Techfest, there recently organized a fest wish you have to attend an IIT Madras this is an online program so you have to draw travel for 3 days from wherever you are and these three days you have to pay all the charges it's like if you are born with a silver spoon then you can afford it."
