Aditya,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.3,Thapar university review,"The faculty are knowledgeable but the curriculum of the college is outdated. Some faculty struggle to clear doubts about the latest software and technologies.
I had chosen this course as it is the best option currently in terms of job opportunities and growth.
The faculty ratio is decent there are about 70 faculty members for CS. The Ph.D. students also teach a few subject tutorials.
All the faculty members are Ph.D. holders, most of them have decent teaching methods but few are unable to clear the doubts of the students properly.
There are 2 exams held during the semester one mid sem and the other end sem and they are held 2 months apart. The exam's difficulty level ranges between medium and hard, it depends on the student's understanding of the concepts."
SOURAV BAG,Bengal Institute of Technology - [BIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.6,A college with great placement.,"I choose the course because I am interested in Computer related work and I need a job in an IT company. The teachers are very helpful, qualified, and knowledgeable. All are with Ph.D. degrees. Their teaching quality is very good. The exam will be held on every semester. Yes, this course is curriculum-relevant. Yes, it makes the student industry-ready. If someone studies properly there is not that much difficulty with the semester exams in this college."

yash,IIT BHU - Indian Institute of Technology,"B.Tech, Mining Engineering",9.5,All you need to know about IIT BHU,I choosed mining engineering because there is a lot of requirments in this feild in India which are to be fulfilled as the demands are increasing day by day. Also this course is easy and you can have time to prepare for other exams like UPSC CSE and so on. Teachers are very highly qualified and are always ready to solve your problems. there is a huge number of teachers and for each speciality about 4-5 teachers are available and in mining department about 50 -60 faculty members are there. Till now I have given online exams but offline exams are yet to come. courses are same as in civil and mechanical and are very easy and interesting. but for some courses you need to work really hard.

Naranath Golpeda,Rayagada Autonomous college,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Zoology",8.0,My Six Month life in Rayagada Autonomous College,"The College Campus is not very large. There are many classrooms for different Hons students. There is also a library inside the College. But we were not getting any journals monthly and yearly. The books in the library are not sufficient for all the students studying in this college. There are labs in the College. Inside the College Campus, there are many playgrounds for playing Cricket, Volleyball, Kabbadi, and Kho Kho. The College conducts many sports for selecting the students. Our college recently celebrated the unforgettable Basant Mahatsov in the month of March. Many games, competitions, and quizzes were conducted on this occasion. We enjoyed ourselves a lot at this festival."
Maddi Sravya,Vishnu Institute of Technology - [VIT],"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",8.0,My experience,"There are many clubs for the placements in the college which develop the coding skills many workshops take place in college which develop skills in the students.

Surendra Kumar,IIT BHU - Indian Institute of Technology,"B.Tech, Mining Engineering",8.4,IIT BHU compelete information from starting to end.,"The course curriculum is very light, there are only 4 or 5 courses per semester and you get ample time to hustle around.
The faculty are also cool and remain friendly with you. The exams are very timely, we have 2 papers per semester per subject."
