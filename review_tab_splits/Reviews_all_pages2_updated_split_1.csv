Most of the time I have noticed that the teachers are not appointed at the start of the semester and when 1.5 or 2 months pass, the teacher is appointed and she just has to complete the syllabus so she will do whatever she can to complete it. Teachers are qualified but some of them don't know how to interact with students which is why the ratio of attendance is 15 out of 42. No student wants to come to the college because the classes are not at all interactive. Now, if I discuss about the exams then they came from the university so no matter if the teacher is interested in teaching or she cares about the student's lacking areas or not but we have to study as per the syllabus on our own."
MOHAMMAD IMRAN KHAN,Sanskar Educational Group - [SEG],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",6.5,INSIDE OUT OF SEG CAMPUS,"The fees were fixed for 4 years by us during admission only but there is a little bit hike in fees per year from the central university and various other charges for projects and seminars are also added in  3 and 4 years.

The placement quality was average and I got placed in a non-tech company with a package of 2.4 lakh/annum ctc."

Shivam Kumar,GITA Autonomous College - [GITA College],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.4,"GITA AUTONOMOUS COLLEGE, BHUBANESWAR TRUTH AND REAL REVIEW","I just wanted to be an engineer so I choosen this course. The faculty is a little good, you will see that boys are more than girls, like in EEE, mech etc branch there is almost no girls, but in cse, csit, csds there are some girls, like if there are 68 students in class then there are 20-25 girls in the classroom. Qualifications of the faculty are good, as everyone knows that nothing is perfect, so also here some faculty have good teaching methods and some have bad teaching methods. There are two exams in a semester, a semester is of 6 months but it is completed in almost 4.5 to 5 months, in a semester one is a mid sem test and after that one is the final semester exam, if you studied little more and do little hard work them semester exam is nothing for you."
RITIK KUMAR,Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Biotechnology",7.0,NIT Jalandhar (Biotechnology),"Although I got this branch because of my rank I found it quite interesting also it has lots of scope in the coming year, especially in India. Faculty to students ratio can be nearly 1/12 (for biotechnology precisely). Although all faculties are well qualified but not all of them have good teaching skills. While Some faculty try to explain things passionately while some just came to do their job. Till last year, two minors and one major exam were there but now it's updated to one mid-term and one major examination. Yeah! If your goal is to just pass the exam it's easy, you can do it in 1-2  days of study but for getting good grades you have to study regularly. Also, most of the faculty do absolute marking which also makes it hard for average students to get good grades."

They all are extremely qualified except for some professors(2-3). I couldn't go for any circuital branch(except ICE) so took this, no special reason. Every prof has his own style of teaching. Passing the exams is a bit scary, as they put up a question paper which can be really hard. The faculty is passionate but lacks the resources in labs to demonstrate like in IITs where the labs are extravagant in comparison to ours. Anyone who is passionate about mechanical engg can consider this as one of the best options, but if you are considering working towards a tech role, it becomes really hectic to tackle academics and placement prep."

Naman goel,Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",9.0,DR BR Ambedkar National institute of technology Jalandhar [NIT JALANDHAR] review,"I choose this course because NIT JALANDHAR is a government-reputed college. And generally, students want to take admitted here for getting placed in MNCs. So I also chose this course for exploring and enhancing my skills within the environment of such a reputed college. Talking about the student ratio, generally in every branch girls to boys ratio is 1:4. Now let's talk about faculty so the way of delivering content to the professors is superb, not only in academics even if you learn a lot about the extra curriculum. All the professors graduated from IITs, NITs. so they have an experience in btech student lifestyle. But some faculty are rude also. Currently exam system has been changed earlier we have to give 2 minors and 1major exam to clear the semester but now only one mid sem and one end sem exam are there."
Student (Anonymous),Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.5,Review of Nit Jalandhar by a Btech CSE student,"The fee structure for hostler (per year) will be 
Income plays key role if you belongs to either General category or OBC category

51000+50000(if income is less than 1 lakh or if you belongs to Sc/St/physically handicapped category irrespective of your family income)
92680+50000(if income is between 1 lakh and 5 lakhs) 
176000+50000(if income is greater than 5 lakhs) 

If you opt for day-scholar it will be 17000 lesser than hostler.
If you opt for day-scholar with bus facilities it will be 11000 lesser than hostler. 

You can apply for only one scholarship for an annual year. I am getting scholarship from FFE . I am receiving 60,000 rupees as scholarship amount per year. My college is providing an average of 17 lakhs package. So I don't have much worry about Job.My branch has almost hundred percentage job ratio.

In my class, there are around 80 students and for theory lectures, we all sit in one classroom together but for labs and tutorials our class is divided into three groups for better interaction. The majority of faculties are good and but 1-2 have old methods of teaching and are arrogant.

Some of the faculty are good but some are worse than the worst.

The exams were like all of a sudden, you need to write 1½ months continuously covering Sem, lab externals, mid.. and the correction be like the 1st sem is good and the 2nd sem is bad in every year."

Some just read off ppts, while some spend a generous amount of time explaining concepts. You'll receive a mixed bag every semester.

Vivek Kumar Bharti,Delhi University - [DU],"BA {Hons.}, French",7.0,Delhi University Insights on ground level,"The DU fests are all popular that we celebrate and are celebrated in the month of February. The tech fest and annual fest both are conducted in the month of February. The books and journals are all available in the library and all are related to the courses. Amenities in the classroom are all good but we got only 2-3 rooms for the advanced skill learning. In my college, we haven't got a playground and have no extra cocurricular activities on campus which hearts us more. Many social groups are run by students and most of them are conducted by students only. They also conduct NGOs and fest celebrations."
Preeti Bhunjawa,XIM University,"MBA, Rural Management",10.0,Review for XIM University,"There is a placement committee in the university that immensely helps students regarding all the placements and internship issues.

Apart from them lots and lots of fests, and functions continue to happen throughout the year( when I say, 'lots and lots', I really mean it, like every month there are like at least 3-4 major events happening, and singers, comedians do visit every now and then). The library is great. Many books and journals are available. University also gives access to journals online if they are not available in the library physically. The classrooms are neat and clean and air-conditioned. There are a total of 3 playgrounds and a fully professionally equipped indoor stadium including a badminton court, volleyball court, shooting zone, and Olympic size swimming pool. In simple words, the infrastructure is one of the best in this country and you will never feel bad about it thorough out your college life. Plenty of clubs and societies are there, you can join according to your interests."

Ananya Pappula,"CVR College of Engineering, Ibrahimpatnam","B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.0,cvr school of engineering,"The people here are super cool and talented but the college is bent on not letting us have fun so despite having clubs like the literature and debate club we dont really get the required time or resources from the college to help with the events. The library is good only if you want technical/education-related books. we have two major fests namely sahityotsav and Ciencia but for some reason, we didn't have Ciencia this year. The infrastructure is pretty nice."

Pranavi Reddy,Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - [JNTU],"B.Pharma,",7.0,Review on JNTUA,Placements are provided from 4-1 semester. But the companies didn't provide the required payment. The highest package is just 2.5 lpa. Many people get the placement but fewer members get joined because of less salaries. After getting the degree I want to join M.Pharmacy.

 There are very less sports and extracurricular activities on campus. It occurs just as an eye wash for a University. I think curricular activities are important for each and every student for their refreshment and health improvement.
Most of the books on microbiology are not available in the library.
Classrooms are not neat and clean.
There is no social group or club."
