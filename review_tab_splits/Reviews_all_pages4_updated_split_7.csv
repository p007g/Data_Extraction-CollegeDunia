My college course curriculum is very good and very upgraded, practical based which makes us so helpful to enhance and strengthen our knowledge.

Prashanthi Jagannathan,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Sc + M.Sc, Biotechnology",7.3,VIT as a fresher,"My reasons for choosing this course we're that it was biology related, did not have maths in 12th as a requirement, and is a five-year course so I can pursue a Ph.D. immediately upon graduation. I was also pretty tired of entrance and competitive exams after 12th so I did not want to go through that again after 3 years if I'd chosen to do a BSc.
The faculty: student ratio is not very desirable as there are over 50 students in each class crammed into tiny classrooms. There are over 160 students in the 2022 batch and only three groups so it does get pretty cramped.
The quality of the faculty I feel is quite average. Some teachers are amazing and always know how to engage the class and keep it interesting, while some only read out slides and leave them at that. There are strict teachers and easy-going ones like every other University and school. 
You'll have an exam almost every month and a half and it's an endless cycle. CAT1, CAT2, and FAT with assignments and quizzes which is pretty frustrating."
Sriman narayanan,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.2,Miracles of VIT,"The fee structure is hideous, if you get below the 5000 ranks there is a high chance you can get the lowest fee of 200000 but if you fail to get so you will have to pay like 300000, 400000, 450000, 500000. Some people say there is still a 6th category i.e 600000 and the 7th i.e 700000. This is just too much rip-off, never get to the college if you get more than 300000."

Faculty members are supportive. I choose this course because it fits my jee rank. Also, I want to do btech. You can ask subject-related doubts without any hesitation to faculty members. I think maybe all teachers are of Ph.D. level. The teaching methods of some teachers are good and some you may don't like little. It also depends on the students."
Jyotiraditya Sikder,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),"BE {Hons.}, Chemical Engineering",9.8,BITS Pilani - Its Magic,The course curriculum is well structured and you are given the freedom to choose any course at any point in time provided you have fulfilled the prerequisites. You are given the freedom to build your own timetable and choose your own professors. 100% of the Professors are experienced and have a well-performed post-doctorate from a reputed university. There is faculty to student ratio of around 1:3 in every branch and you can approach any Professor with your doubts. Evaluations are one of the most brainstorming times where papers are mostly original and are difficult to score higher marks.
Karan Baid,VIT Bhopal University,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.7,Honest Fresher Review,"The annual fest is called ADVITYA which is quite a refresh and enteratining fest offering various events such as drama , gaming , sports , concerts , dnacing , singing, art & literarture , anime events and many more. There is a 2 floor library and is good place if you want to do you work in peace. But the library timings is less according to me as it closes at 6 pm on weekdays and on weekdays it closes at 4 pm. Classrooms have a strength of 70 on an average. Some classrooms are too luxurious for a classroom but also there are few pretty ok for a classroom. There are quite a few clubs such as gaming club, robotics club, IOS club , android development club, sports club , even an anime club and many more clubs. Many of which are operated by students. The only thing I think to warn you about is that boys hostel is around 2 km far from academic block thus you have to walk quite a lot .But if you go with your friends,to be honest it dosent bother that much. Cycle is allowed also."

Each and every college of DU organizes its fest every year which is best in itself. Usually, it is organized in the months of February and March.
Again, the infrastructure of Du colleges is different from each other. However, no college has bad infrastructure. Those who have old buildings are working for re-innovation.
If I talk about college libraries, then for me there is no book that we cannot get from Library.
Also, sports facilities can be judged by this line: Almost all common genes are there in colleges and there are tournaments or matches which are being organized at college levels, University levels, etc.
There are many social groups of students e.g Unity in my college. However, I never joined anything.?"

The faculty is too good. And faculty members are very helpful and knowledgeable. one student is under two mentors (faculty member). They tell about others worlds then medical life.
Qualification of faculty is MD, MCH, and other higher degrees. But their teaching method is not enough for clearing the neet-pg exam. In my first year, three semesters and one pre-proof and then proof exam were conducted.

But for maintaining a scholarship to have to maintain a 7.5 CGPA. For that, you have to study hard. Because CU's exams are of unexpected nature.

Umansh Agarwal,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.7,What is it like being an SRMite,"The course that I chose was CSE, with a specialization in IoT. I am, to an extent, satisfied with the system and opportunities I received with this course. I want to mention to all the freshers that you must create an opportunity and grab it. You can not rely on others to always help you out. For example, when I heard about the concept of in-house projects in SRM, I was probably the first in my batch to go ahead and start a project with my faculty members. Because of this, I have gained a lot of reputation and received offers from many teachers for research. I am currently doing research under faculty from Saudi Arabia and developing ML models. The teachers over here can thus be concluded as very supportive and well-qualified. The male-to-female ratio over here is way better than the colleges I know about. Exams are also pretty easy to pass and take up a good test of your knowledge. I have also felt that the college's curriculum indirectly trains the students enough for higher studies."
