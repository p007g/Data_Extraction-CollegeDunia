Student (Anonymous),JD Institute of Fashion Technology Hauz Khas,"Diploma, Fashion Design",10.0,WELCOME TO IMAGINATION,"JD Institute of fashion and technology is one of the finest institutes, which is well known for its a practical approach towards learning. Since my passion for Fashion designing landed me in this course and this institute, the most mesmerizing part about their curriculum is the workshops that are held almost every day. The course curriculum is not only supposed to include the subjects related to a particular field but it should also include activities that help students develop a strong sense of their own design aesthetic and offer the same to the concerned industry. Be it the HOD, the course director or the faculties, they all are highly educated and highly experienced. Be it routine classes or the assignments or the workshops, they all have been a great support system in my learning. Now that the learning system has switched to online learning, the faculty makes sure to clear all our doubts well in time and prepare us well for the Exams which are held twice a year and are very easy to clear"

If you live in a dorm, it is like being at a massive sleepover with all your friends, every night. People are just a few doors down and always looking to hang out. Therefore, it takes profound skill to juggle both academics and social life. Usually, on the weekends, we get together and cook dinner because eating out in the city is expensive. We make a lot of extra food so we all have leftovers throughout the week. Other regular activities we do together include going to concerts, plays, and poetry readings.

Srishti chakravarty,Medi-Caps University,,8.7,My journey of being MedicapsAn,"I joined Btech CTIS, so fees for specialization is 1.2 lakh per year and for normal Btech in computer science it is 1 lakh, 80 k for electrical and other branches.
If you are eligible for a scholarship then you will get a heavy decrease in fees but not then you have to pay this much my friend, as I already told you during admission only they will clear everything, exam fees are taken apart from this 2 k every sem, and it is the policy of MU that every year fees is increased by 10 k but not for you, for the new batches, means your fees structure will be same they told you at the time of admission no hike for you. For example, if you took admission in Btech Vs your fees will be 1 lakh but if you will take admission next year your fees will be 1.1 lakh per year. 
This means if you are localite then it will cost you around 1.24 lakh every year only fees."

There is one faculty for each subject teaching almost 60 students. So id say there is a 1:60 teacher-student ratio per subject. 
I honestly don't remember any qualifications of the faculty, most didn't tell and I never bothered asking. But the teaching methods were great. studying for two semesters id deduce that 8 out of every 10 faculties are excellent in their job.
There were a lot of exams and short tests for every subject. 7 exams for one subject including Vivas and short tests."
Mahir ali,Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre,"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",9.5,A brief review of my college.,"The ability to pay varies widely among the students. The fees was already right from the inception of the law schools, but the rs 70000 per annum or so fee was not found to be something unmanageable even by those who didn't have the money as benks were forthcoming with education loan as even the bank were aware of the 100% recruitment rate in nujs. There is no doubt that expenses are increasing and fees paid by the students is the source of income from the law schools like nujs which take pride  in its financial independence.
However, aanyone familiar with the law school sceneries will be able to tell you that some very important thing have been overlooked.
I didnt got any scholarships from government but I got scholarships from college. That is very beneficial for me at that time. And now at this time the fees are hike and its sometimes difficult for many students to give this type of money. It seems like a good time to be a electrical engineering and I will be able to tell you that"

The class size here is about 60 which isn't too bad. The teachers are well qualified but knowing something and being able to teach it are two different things. Similar to almost everywhere else, there are a few excellent teachers and a few not-so-great teachers who only read PDFs in classes. As I have only taken online classes, I can't be sure about their teaching proficiency offline.

For 1st semester, after a short 3-month online semester with 1 viva, 1 long, and 3 short tests, we were supposed to give offline end semester exams. 1st sem results aren't out yet but a few teachers have told us that quite a lot of students have been failed.

Talking about faculty there are a good number of friendly teachers, they are ready to help you at any point of time, academically they are good and educated.
There are several PhDs in our college, many have good methods of teaching, but few new teachers have come they need to be better but I think is this a new experience for them so they might be nervous.
After the end of each sem that is 3 months or so we had a semester exam If you ask me the exams are moderate difficulty level but the vtu's correction system is not that appreciable and this was a drawback back then but now BMSIT doesn't come under vtu so it's a good thing for the new people joining."

We had around 42 students in the class. But, not all students had a steady attendance. Thus, around 30 students would be present in the class each day. The teachers are highly trained and help the students in all possible ways. They also encourage the students to take up challenging tasks at college. The teachers are very specific to details and therefore, the assignments need to be completed neatly and within the given deadline. The exams are conducted by Calcutta University and are taken in the months of July (for even semester) and December (for odd semester). However, you hardly get any semester breaks. The syllabus is also huge but standard question papers are set. So if you work hard and study well, you can easily pass."
