The fees have to be paid if you have to even be the college. Being an autonomous college they only care about money.
They are plenty of scholarships available but you cannot choose all, and even if you choose which could potentially pay the whole college fee they intentionally reject your applications due to unknown reasons.
As a reserved student, my scholarship was supposed to come from the government, which it did but they took an additional 30k per year which is not included in the scholarship it seems.
If you are a non-reserved student you have to take a loan hoping that that should cover everything but not they intentionally don't add all the expenses and the student has to pay from his pocket which isn't covered in the loan.
There is no job guarantee but you get companies in the college. Also, they take an extra 21k at the end as a Placement fee."

Almost all Faculties are very well educated They all have Completed their Ph.D.'s from TOP Colleges but all of them have a different style of teaching. Some Faculties are also Assistant Professors who are pursuing their Ph.D. simultaneously, so due to less experience they might not good as the other qualified professors but they have their teaching work along with the Degree that they should have to acquire, so It's not their fault either.
There are two types of exams - Midterm and End term: According to me, both are at a moderate level."

Now hello, 1.5 Lakh for studying Engineering is not that huge amount I guess. Still, a student credit card scheme is there and for minority communities, there are also some scholarships available.

and if you prepare by yourself I mean you have to prepare yourself for placements if you want a good placement. If you rely on college for everything then you will get disappointed, you will get placed but not on a higher package. There are so many companies that are big MNCs like TCS, Capgemini, etc are gonna come and recruit so many students so you don't have to worry about your job if you have at least an average score in all of your semesters. To sit in the placements you have to maintain a 7.5 cgpa every semester. The college supports you if have an idea and you want to do any startups you can take guidance from the faculty and seniors.

And had a keen interest in programming languages. It always fascinated me that we can write code and make the computer work the way we desire. This has endless possibilities for application. 
Since I am from the CSE department. I would say in the Batch 2015-19 around 180 student were there divided into 4 sub sections. As It would not be possible to manage the number at once. So for each subject there are dedicated faculties which belongs to the department but there are certain subjects which were common to other department so other department teachers also used to teach CSE students. 
Most of the teachers had qualifications as Master of their subjects.
Tech qualified. Only a few of the teachers were Ph.D. qualified. The teaching method of the First & second-year faculties was very good. They focus on leaning of students but in the third and fourth years teaching faculties don't pay that much attention to the student. Students have to rely mostly on self-studies."

Teachers are very supportive here some of the teachers have good teaching methods as well but the reality is that in a college you have to do everything yourself. It is easy to pass semester exams but you have to study hard one night before the exam

Student (Anonymous),Amity University,"B.P.T,",8.7/10,Amity University Noida . A good place for studying,"This course helped me to full fill my dream I have the opportunity to give others a happy life through physiotherapy. This course is also very demanding.
About 100 students in one batch of the first semester and so on and there are appropriate for them around 20 teachers for physiotherapy students.
 All faculty members are Ph.D. and masters and have a prefix of Dr. In their names. 
Teaching is also very good they cover every topic and every part of the syllabus with full-time studying and help you to understand easily.
Exams difficulty depends upon you if you don't study you will be failed if you study regularly it will be very easy to clear the exam without any tension .exams were held 2 times in a semester one-time internals in the mid of semester and 1 external exam at the end of the semester."

10 faculty on 50 students, so I think the faculty: students ratio is good enough.
All the teachers are Ph.D. holders or persuing a Ph.D., and they use the latest technologies like projectors, computers, and slideshow for a better understanding of students.
The exams were timely on 6 months as per CBS but when I read there was the yearly exam. The exams were easy to pass."

From the good playground to well maintained and good canteen. The students came from all the nearby States. The college was at a prime location because of which all the basic facilities were available within walking distance. The staffs were also well-behaved from the security guards to the canteens staff and the academic staff. But the academic staff used to make us wait a lot even for small stuff which I felt was a waste of time. The emergency facility was up to mark. Engineering life is good, in my experience, it's so much fun here, like cricket, basketball, football, badminton, volleyball, etc playing here in campus grounds and indoors .it's safe and it's emergency facilities are available."
AMIT kumar Sharma,Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",6.6/10,Internship,"computer Science engineering is the best Course for Getting a Good Job in Big Companies Like Google, Microsoft, Wipro, etc

Shashwat anand,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Mathematics And Computing",8.5/10,DTU -a college to remember,DTU has very amazing campus life especially when it comes to hostels. Hostelers enjoy their college life more than Day scholars. But mess food is really shitty. It needs a huge amount of improvement Fest of DTU is very renowned. Engifest is known to have the largest football but unable to organize in past few years due to COVID-19. There are huge numbers of societies operating in the college ranging from technical to cultural.
Ankit Singh,Idyllic Institute Of Management,"BBA, General",5.4/10,College life,The fee is nominal in terms of its infrastructure and faculty guidance but the only problem with fees is pushing students to pay fees in sem wise system to pay the whole fee in one shot before half a year ends. Several opportunities come in scholarships and others.

They are well wishers for the students and they also help them in many other activities.
I choose the course because I want to go into the highway sector.
the faculty-student ratio is  1:12.
There are 2 exams in a period of 6 months ( semester) Mid-term and End term. The mid-term exam contains less syllabus so it is easy to score there while the end-term exams are relatively tough and lengthy."
Ritesh,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Mathematics And Computing",7.8/10,Dtu in crisp.,"Campus Life if overall is very good in comparison to other universities.
There are different societies for different purposes like cultural societies like madhurima, pratibimbh,kalakriti etc and various tech societies 
The annual fest of dtu is  Engifest which is usually held in the month of Jan-Feb every year.
Talking about no. of books in the library you will get 5-10 types of books on each topic written by different authors and publishers and even dtu has an online library which contains almost 450,000 e-books.
Aminities:-Every classrooms have enough space to hold the sitting of 70-80 students at a time and also has some large rooms too whose capacity is to accommodate even 120-150 students.
Every classroom has a projection system too.
Sports and extracurricular activities are somewhat nice and compulsory too if you opt for sports in electives and even you can play on your own because sports facilities are soo good in dtu.
There are different societies which are fully run by students only."
