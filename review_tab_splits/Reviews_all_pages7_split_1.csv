Mule Mukesh,Kakatiya University College of Engineering and Technology -[KUCE&T],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.3,KUCET Student,"I chose this course because I was interested in computer science and engineering. When coming to the faculty they are not up to the mark. well, I should say that they are not very proficient in their subjects and they only teach students on the syllabus and from the exams point of view. They don't teach brief concepts. And there are very less faculty members, in which there is little experienced faculty. Most faculty have completed their masters of technology and pursuing their PhD in our college. When coming to exams it is not very tough to pass the exams or to get a good scores, and there would 2 mid-exams, a semester exam, a lab internal, and a lab external conducted for every semester. The semester will be completed in 4 months and after 2 months 1st mid is conducted and after 2 months 2nd mid is conducted, semester, lab internal, and lab external follow. But the results would be delayed for too long time."
Prajwal Patil,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.2,My deep and critical review about IIIT NAGPUR after living very nearly,"We have tantrafiesta as techfest and abhivyakti as a cultural fest. The technical fest is done in offline mode in October month In this year the arrange in offline very few colleges outside college participate in it. Management of the college is not actively participating in the fest in form of providing funds. We don't have a sports ground. Now the college just flats the ground for a sports facility. We only have a badminton court single in the hostel block and a very small basketball court not in a proper way. There are only studies not any activities like Navratri or any other festival celebration. We only do the Ganesh festival until now. Abhivyakti has not been done in offline mode until now in a new campus online we have had a good response from other colleges. We have many coding clubs, music clubs, and orator clubs. Orator club is most active in college. Others are only for just names. There are no proper clubs for refreshments. College only has competitive programming coding culture not other fields like data science and web development."

I am talking about all the streams. If someone is coming to college by the management quota they might have a hard time getting a return on investment, the donation is really high if they go in at the last moment, I am sure it's the same everywhere. There are so many opportunities in placements, the students are well prepared for their jobs as they provide compulsory internships, so by the end of last year, everyone is well prepared. Job placements are really good, more than 5 students got the packages of 20L last year 1 got 30L as well, although it's tough for the mechanical course, the placement in mechanical is kinda poor sure is more than enough for those who get it, The placements in others streams are amazing, especially computer science its 100% placement.

As far as faculty is concerned in my opinion the faculty is great because 3 of 6 teachers are IITIANS which is still an amazing thing and for the ratio, it is pretty unequal in my class ratio is 40:12 boys to girls. So. this seems unfair.
As stated above faculty is so advanced and intellectually smart that they interact with every student and explain every topic with interesting facts and new ways which make engineering fun to learn.
As far as exams are concerned Sessional Tests 1,2 and Pre-University Tests are arranged regularly to prepare students for University Exams. The term exams are neither too difficult nor too easy if one studies daily he can achieve a great score in exams."

Amit Gupta,KIET Group of Institutions - [KIET],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.5,Best college for average student,"Btech is a trending course with job opportunities at this time skyrocketing. 
This was my motivation to choose this course but if anyone's dream is to become a software engineer or is interested in ai ml or other stuff this is the course for them. A class of 60 students is taken with one teacher taking the class. 
But there are extra faculty for labs and in case some teacher is absent or left the college immediately. 
So approx ratio would be 1:50
The teachers are qualified and their teaching reviews are quite good they make students learn the course teachers don't encourage students to do extracurricular activities. Basically, in class, there is a school-type surrounding. But outside you can decide what u have to do. 
Exams are easy a student can easily pass the exam with one-day prior study to the exam. 
Quantum book all college students may hear of it is enough for passing and topping in class."
Satish Singh,Graphic Era Hill University - [GEHU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.0,GEHU Review,"Fests are organized every 2-3 months and in between that some mini-events keep on happening. 
There are many books available in Library but all of them are related to the curriculum of various courses and they don't allow us to issue books other than our course.
Classrooms are good in terms of lighting, air conditioning, and comfort. 
Sports activities are not a strong part of this college. They don't have the infrastructure and space for many sports and there are many many students. If you go out to play volleyball then there would be around 15 players per side. And there is just one volleyball court.
There are clubs like the Photography club, Bhangra club, Kavyanjali club(creative writing), and Shikhar club(entrepreneurship)."

Several events are conducted every year which give better exposure to students. The environment is really friendly and interactions are real and natural. There are various clubs that students can join and learn a lot about leadership skills and crowd management, etc. The exams are conducted almost every month and it is possible to study everything the night before.

raghavendra,Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology - [KMIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.0,My College Review,JNTU-H designed the Course Curriculum. As our Institute is affiliated with JNTU-H we follow the same curriculum.  I chose ECE as I was inclined toward Electronics. The Faculty: Students Ratio is about 1:60. Most of our faculty are well-versed and have a teaching experience of around 10-15 years so faculty was never a problem. Faculty since the pre-pandemic have adopted the PPT method of teaching and it's straightforward for us students to understand the concept all the classes are well equipped with projectors so there's no problem with that. Term Exams are always on time despite the pandemic our schedule is on par with what it was previously. Term exams were never difficult to pass as our faculty properly taught the concepts making it easy for the end-sem exams.
Ritesh Shetty,NMAM Institute of Technology - [NMAMIT],,7.7,NMAMIT- A world in itself to Explore.,"The curriculum is almost up to date. The curriculum mostly covers all the major topics needed, but you need to put in effort from your end for specialization in a particular domain. The college doesn't give you deep learning of a particular topic. The teachers are approachable and provide all the knowledge they have regarding a topic. Several events are conducted every year which give better exposure to students. The environment is really friendly and interactions are real and natural. There are various clubs that students can join and learn a lot about leadership skills and crowd management, etc. The exams are conducted almost every month and it is possible to study everything the night before. The student ratio in college is about 1:3 I would say overall. In most of the Computer-related branches, it is mostly 1:1."

Talking about the teachers and student ratio It is pretty much optimum but a few subjects do have not a particular teacher for our college hires a guest teacher to teach that subject. Most of the teachers are doctorate holders. And talking about examinations we have a midsemester examination as well as a semester examination.

Student (Anonymous),"University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Maharshi Dayanand University - [UIET]","B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.0,Want To Enjoy Life of Freedom,"Campus life is sort of dull; we only go there to attend classes; there is no other compelling reason to enroll in college. There are no clubs in which students can take part. Except for the large youth festival, which attracts participants from several colleges it's a big 2-3 day fest, and no festivals will be held here.
The library is quite large; there are two libraries, one tiny with solely Btech-related literature and the other a three-story university library with a large a/c reading room that is open around the clock.
As a result of the fact that Haryana is well-known for its sporting events, I can affirm that there are no compromises made when it comes to sports. We even have a cricket stadium and swimming pool with a 15ft depth. State-level sports competitions are held here."
Siddharth Saumya,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science And Systems Engineering",7.7,Honest review of KIIT ????,"My rank was less than what it should be to get CSE so i had to choose CS&SE. Till my batch had around 3500 students including all branches. But now they have 5000 or so. So i think teacher student ratio will be around 1:100 or something. Faculties are well educated but many are not well educated and they just try to act like they have good knowledge but they take reference from google for small things. As i said it depends on what faculty you get. Some are super good with the subjects they teach and some are not good enough. Worst part is their bad english. Most of them are form odisha and their english is not good enough for a professor.
Terms exams are take twice a semester. And they are pretty easy to pass if you have studied well."

So as compared to other colleges, our college does not have a big ground to play sports like Cricket and Football.
Moreover, there is a separate gym and swimming pool as well for both boys and girls.

College have hubs where students can join and participate in the events and can organize as well when they come in 3rd year. But overall social life is not that good after covid as no big events are being organized since 2019.

The Library at the college is not that large but have most of the famous books for study."

ROSHAN,SAL Institute of Technology and Engineering Research - [SITER],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",5.5,On Summary college is best for study but if your dream is big and you want to get higher package then you need to think out of the box and do different .,"My Reason behind taking admission to this college is the seat. I got a two-seat in this college so take admission to this college. 
TFWS seat is nothing but if you take admitted to any GTU college then it has tuition fees which is a very big amount for any college fess it can deduct from that student. In my case, I pay around 300 rupees per year. 
All the faculty have done their M.tech and M.E but some of them are not well experienced in teaching . and some of the faculty have great knowledge about a subject which gives you a depth knowledge. On the other hand, some faculty are just book readers means they just read the book and write on a board. It doesn't make any sense. 
The exam was conducted in two semesters first mid-exam and the last exam conducted by you. Which is much more difficult some students just check the previous year paper and that is you see that question asked in their last exam is easy to pass"
