Sai Sateesh kasaragadda,Bharath University - Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research - [BIHER],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.7,Bharath University overall review,"Basically, I'm very much interested in using systems and mobile phones since my schooling so CSE is somewhat related to my interests so I chose this course.

Faculty members are very friendly in nature and they can even explain twice or thrice if we have a doubt and when it comes to students ratio in engineering it is completely dominated by Telugu students and mostly 80% of engineering students were from Telugu states and girls were very less in strength when compared to boys.

Qualification of faculty are PhD and the quality of teaching is well and good

There will be internal exams and mid exams and semester exams and it was not much difficult to pass just maintaining a proper running notes and revising that notes before exams is enough to get pass in exams"

Hemanth Zacharias,Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering,"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.0,Good choice in Vizag,Actually very lax in conducting fests. Used to conduct very mediocre fests in pre covid years. Technical fest was good but the cultural fest was not up to mark. No fest conducted since 2020. Very well provided library but could be more student friendly. The card system need to be updated. Many fans and lights in classrooms are in repair condition and not working which is a huge problem for students and faculty alike in summer. Very less digital classrooms. Less maintained bathrooms. College has less interest in sports. Badly equipped sports room and pt department. Sports competitions not conducted regularly. Should implement mandatory extra circular hours in curriculum to encourage students. Many social groups available including Rotaract chapter.
