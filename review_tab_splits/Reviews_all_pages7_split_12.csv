If you look over the placement stats you will get to know that this branch is competing with the computer science branch..The highest package of our college is from the ECE branch.
The faculty is highly qualified but you know in most the cases you have to manage your workload on your own. Every semester has 2 minor exams (at a gap of approx. 2 months) and then finally an end-semester examination (called a major exam). 
Passing these exams is not easy if you are not regular with your academic syllabus. The marking scheme is not very lenient. Even then many of our batchmates score very well by studying at the very last minute."

Shadan Akhtar,Aliah University,"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",5.6,Aliah University (Honest review),"Regarding the present situation, the campus placements of government colleges are dry enough. Companies don't usually come for the campus placements and if they do so they don't offer a high package such as 14-15 lakhs per annum. But a minimum of 3-4 lakhs package can be assured for students. 
Students don't usually get placed in-campus from the college what they do is off-campus placements. 
The highest package last year offered was 9.5 lakhs per annum which is a good amount in Kolkata. 
My plan after the completion, of course, is to get placed off-campus in a good company of course that requires me to be especially skilled enough."

Sajit karki,Assam University,"M.Sc, Ecology & Environmental Science",7.5,My campus life,The campus is situated in a very beautiful place near Silchar which is very peaceful and provides the perfect environment for the students. The maintenance is needed since most of the construction is in bad condition. The Library provides most of the books but the lack of a study place is a concern to be focused on. Classrooms are currently in developing condition. There is a sports complex provided which is closed since I visited the University. There are many social media groups and pages run by the students where we can discuss our problems.
