But as the offline year started there was a major gap in syllabus completion and exams.
syllabus was not completed.

Sourav,Graphic Era Hill University - [GEHU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.4,GEHU- Review,"1:- having an interest in computers led me to choose this course.
2:-there are not enough faculty (one faculty) who have to complete the syllabus in roughly 4-5 sections of the student.
3:-faculties are well qualified. Most of them have a good experience of teaching.
But a major problem is that in the CSE branch most of the time faculties are interchanged.
Faculties are not placed as per their quality.
 they have just filled the vacated positions.
Honestly, it feels that 6 months are not enough to complete the syllabus of one semester.
Roughly Mid sem are conducted after 1.5 months into the semester and end-term are conducted after 5 months. University provides semester timetable. During the corona period, online exams were timely completed. 
But as the offline year started there was a major gap in syllabus completion and exams.
syllabus was not completed.
Exams are not that tough to face, apart from a few subjects most of them ask basic to high-level questions depending on a particular subject."

Student-teacher ratio is around 75. In my class there are 75 students like most of the class as I have confirmed from some of my friends.
Most of the teachers here are highly qualified having a ton of experience, some of the teachers are teaching from past 30-35 years. Teaching methods are somewhat traditional and somewhat modern, mix of both. They use good amount of technologies to teach the students. For term exams, since I am still in 1st semester, so, there have not been term tests till now. But as my seniors have told me about exams, they are not considered, that much hard to pass."

murari gaurav,Academy of Maritime Education and Training University - [AMET],"B.E, Marine Engineering",8.3,Intership opportunities at AMET,"I choose this course because I love learning more things about machines/engines.
After admission, you will get a mentor 1:20 ratio. 1 mentor for 20 students which is great. If you are having any problem, just share it with your mentor, and he will guide you.
Faculty are both mixed, good and bad. Actually, no faculty is bad, it's just that their teaching methodology is different and you didn't cope up with that.
Some teachers are like you will love them, and some you will start hating. Anyway, it's the matter of every college, you have to learn by yourself and stop depending upon professor's to teach. Use the library inside the campus to learn.
Here due to lockdown, everything is delayed. I can't say it with a guarantee but for me, my session started in November 2021, and from 24th January, I am having my CAT-1 Exam."

Student (Anonymous),Government Engineering College,"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",6.3,Review by stoner,"I chose this course just because my father wanted me to choose this otherwise I'd have chosen CSE. Although the time we got admission in the college there was this wide program going on called ""TEQUIP-III"", due to this our branch had almost 10-12 faculty members but now last I heard that changed last year and only 3 permanent faculty left and a couple of lab assistants maybe and in first-year students strength in our branch was 60 and later in the second year it increased to 80 (due to diploma students admissions). 
Faculty during the TEQIP program were highly qualified from different IITs and NITs, although there were a couple of bad teachers there were also some good teachers as you'd find in every college. The permanent faculty was quite good and helpful, especially Dr. Ganpat Sir (HOD of Civil Eng.).
