So, I thought that it would provide me with a variety of knowledge on different aspects of business and was also told that ICG is known for its extra-curricular activities and events, so I took admission. My experience was satisfactory. 50% of the faculty is amazing, no doubt. They are renowned professors with exceptional knowledge and are very helpful. But the rest 50% are just average and below average, either they don't have enough teaching experience and fail to teach in class or their subject knowledge is not very up to the mark. The teaching method of some teachers is outdated, though some use very creative digital tools. Many focus on bookish knowledge rather than practical learning. Exams are semester based with 2 semesters per year, the difficulty level ranges from medium to difficult, if you are regular in-class exams will be easy."
