Priyanshu,Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya Faculty of Engineering & Technology,"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",5.2/10,college Review.,"I have chosen this course because I have had a passion to do engineering since my birth. As I do not get good marks in jee mains so for me there is not an any better option. That's why I have chosen this college. Students to faculty ratio are approx. 40 - 45.  As in the electrical department, there are 7 faculties and students are approx 300. Generally, teachers have pursued M-tech. But some are Ph.D. holders as well. some young teachers are good. Otherwise, you have to study on your own for the exam. Because you will not able to understands all things in the class.  Sometimes semester exams are taken in February. But this time it is on time. It is easy to pass semesters after studying 15 days before the semester."
Riya,Gargi College - [GC],"BA {Hons.}, History",8.0/10,"Knowing Gargi, beyond Review","Through I had an interest in my selected course, I had Political Science at the top of my priority list. However, I did not clear the cutoffs for that.
 I had an acquaintance who was herself a student of Gargi College so I took her reviews on the college and finally took admission.
The faculty especially of history here is considered to be one of the best, therefore I chose this course. And I don't regret it a bit. The faculty members are qualified and pursue different teaching methods for a great classroom environment( conduct trips to supplement class learning). The timings for exams( for all the colleges in DU) were hampered for three semester and they were scheduled earlier as OBE by keeping the pandemic in mind. The OBE exams used to be quite hectic as we were not used to those and it did not give that exam hall environment too. It had been only 2 seems since we appeared for offline exams. For me, they were not difficult to pass. The questions to are usually based on the PYQs only."

Arnav,ABES Engineering College,"B.Tech, Information Technology",8.4/10,Best Private College Review,I have a self-interest in coding that why I choose the Information Technology domain as a suitable course for me. Every department has different faculty members. The student ratio would be approx 60 students per class. Faculties are Highly qualified in my college as many faculty clear the gate exam and many have completed their M.tech degree. Many of them have Ph.D. degrees in their particular domain. The teacher's method was quite good. Many faculty teach in the very proper manner from which students can easily understand the concepts. Term exams were conducted two times in one semester which is of approx 6 months. If you studied properly during lectures you can easily pass and get a good score.

Wali haider,REVA University,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.3/10,My opinion,The admission process is quite complicated but not lengthy. There are three types of modes of admission in this college. The first one is through JEE mains score cutoff which is around 89 percentile or around 80000 ranks for Computer Science and Engineering Branch. The second one is through management quota but the admission fee is a bit more as compared to the previous one. The last mode is through the merit-based selection which is based on class 12th percentage or marks. You can find the application form of this college on their official website or through AKTU counseling. The application fee is 1000 approximately. The date of the application form is released after Jee Main's result.

ADARSH KUMAR,Shoolini University,"B.Pharma,",8.6/10,Shoolini University Review,Most of the faculty members for the B Pharmacy course are either Masters or PhDs. They're also really good at teaching especially the senior professors. The assignment professors however have a slightly different approach which I don't think is any less worth it. All the teachers are really friendly and charming. The best part about this course is the faculty no doubt. Pharmacy has the best teachers in this university. We've 2 mid-term exams and then end term examination. The first mid-term is about 2 months from the start of the semester. After this only one month later we have the second mid-term. And about 1 or 1.5 months later we have our end terms. They are not too difficult if you want to just pass but to get really good marks we've to work pretty hard even for the mid-term.

So teachers told us that either we have to study hard to get direct placements or we have to do BTech after my diploma and luckily I am about to do BTech after my diploma.
There are no social groups or clubs or websites for students but there is a website made by our seniors of our college.  So no doubt we have a bright future ahead and we have to hustle hard.
We just have a WhatsApp group of our college on the name of a social group."
Vishesh Gupta,Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing - [IIITDM],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",9.5/10,Why you should select IIITDMJ over any other college,"Honestly, mechanical engineering was not my first priority, but due to a few ranks, I wasn't able to clear the cut-off for the CSE branch.
Overall the branch is excellent I got to learn a lot throughout the year. I won't say the courses are a piece of cake, if you want to get a good CPI you will have to study I mean it won't be enough to clear the exams with just a night of study.
The faculties are great just they force you to maintain 75 percent attendance. Other than that all professors are great and very cooperative."

Kousik Kayal,University of Calcutta,"B.Tech, Polymer Science and Technology",8.0/10,Honest Review of Polymer Science and Technology Department in Calcutta University,"I have much interest in chemistry so l choose admission in Polymer Science and Technology dept.
In our department, the strength of students is 30 and the ratio B.Sc B.Tech: HS B.Tech is 15:15

Swaraj Mandal,K.C. Das Commerce College,"B.Com, General",4.3/10,Life in KC Das by a student of its own,"Started BCom Honours as I was interested in the financial aspects of a company and the economy overall.
The faculty-student ratio needs to be improved, it's very less as of now. As a rough estimate, it is 1:70.
Although the faculty is highly qualified the teaching methods need to be updated. Some of the new teachers have started adopting new and innovative methods but the previously existing professors need to adapt too.
Due to the global pandemic, our entire curriculum was disrupted. This led to the conduction of 3-semester finals within a single year. Although this can't be blamed upon the college as it is controlled by Gauhati University (which affiliates with our college).
Lastly, speaking of the exam difficulty, you can cover the theoretical part in about 1 month for all the subjects."
