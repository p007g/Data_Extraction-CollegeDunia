Student (Anonymous),Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.3,Life of vitian,"A student with a rank of less than 20k would pay a tuition fee of 1.6 lacs per year, followed by a hostel fee of approximately (on average) 65k per year, depending on your mess caterer and room type (AC/NonAC/Number of roommates). So your college fees will be around 2.3 lacs per year, for a total of 9.2 lacs for four years, including hostel and tuition fees. The remainder will be determined by your pocket money and how much you spend on other things. So, if you choose a 4 bedded non-ac room and a decent mess, the annual rates will be 22000 and 43000, respectively, and 65000 is about the cheapest amount that you will pay for hostel fees.
Scholership:VIT awards scholarships to the top 20000 VITEEE merit holders. Under 10000 rank holders receive a scholarship of 2 lakhs, while 10001–20000 rank holders receive a scholarship of 1 lakh. This scholarship will be paid to you in four quarters (i.e., $50,000 and $25,000 each year) and will be deposited directly into your account.

So your fees will be around 10,75,000 rupees under 10k and 11,75,000 rupees under 20k."

AJIT ROY,University of Calcutta,,9.3,Flashback and review of a department which became family,"Campus Life is more than better of what I expected. Each year an annual fest takes place in the month of September for the introduction of new students to the campus. It doesn't costs anything for the incoming students but the senior students takes the financial responsibility along with other responsibilities. The Tech fest started very recently on 2018, it takes place in March. Except these, each department individually arranges Reunion (has similar vibe like annual fest in a small scale, in the month of April). Along with that My department arranges large scale fest like program on the occasion of International Day of Light (16th May), Picnic (end January/early February), outreach (part of Optics and Photonics students chapter, throughout the year)etc. The university library is one of the biggest library in india, it has every books of its syllabus, out of syllabus, online journal, articles, Computer and internet facility in the library. The Technology Campus has its own small playground, which is enough for little cricket/football. But the campus is surrounded by three big Playgrounds, KB , KVKC, IB ground within 400 km of radius. Department of Applied Optics and Photonics has it's own Facebook and WhatsApp group for both alumni and students. We also have SPIE, OSA and OSI (international Optical societies) student chapter which conducts seminar, conference, outreach programs to spread awareness of Optics and Photonics."

In the first year number of students are less but in the second year lateral students took admission and the seats are getting filled. The faculty members are good enough. But some are there who are lack experience. The main thing is that the teachers are very cooperative with students. The exams timing is according to Makaut as the semester examination questions set by the Makaut University. So exams are also quite tough.
AANCHAL GUPTA,Ramanujan college,"B.Com {Hons.}, General",8.0,Review,"I chose b.com Hons for my graduation as at the time accounts really interested me as a subject and I wanted to gain more insight and knowledge into the core subjects I studied in my higher education. Hence, B.com Hons ticked those boxes for me and I took it for my graduation. The faculty to students ratio would be around 2 teachers for every 60 students. The faculty was well educated and a considerable amount of professors had a doctorate in their subject. Every teacher did an amazing job and was articulate and effective. They even managed to transition to online teaching when the pandemic hit and made sure to involve students as much as they could even though they faced various technological challenges. We had exams after the end of every semester, papers were lengthy but not difficult to pass."

The exam pattern will be like 2 mid-term examinations, pre-finals which will cover all the syllabus hence no student can feel fear of final examinations.

You will get merit-based scholarships if you get top in the branch which they give after an interview. You will not get any financial assistance they will not let you write the exam and humiliate you if you don't pay the fees on time. The companies that come for placements are just minimum package companies they do show big companies coming but they will only send selected students for those exams only those students will be sent to all big companies and they will only get selected in every company. On average, you will get 1.5 to 2.8 LPA companies based on your skills and if you are an above-average student you can get up to 5 LPA but those companies are very rare to come on campus."

Abhishek,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.2,LPU from students view.,I chose btech because it has ample of opportunities in the future. The faculty-student ratio is not that good. You will get one teacher in a class of 70 students. But yes you will get your personal mentor that will help you out in every way they can. You can reach out to them whenever you need any help. The faculties are somehow highly trained. Some are young as well. They complete their masters or PhD from there only. They will teach you very well if you cooperate with them. Although mid-semester exams were MCQ-based so it's easy to clear and end-semester exams are 50-50 means half part is of MCQ and the other half Theory. The same applies to your practice.

SUMAN GARAI,Ramkrishna Mahato Government Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.0,Honest Review of my College,"I had chosen Cse because I was always enthusiastic about coding since my 10th standard so I decided to make my career in this itself.There are 30-35 teachers in this college and students are around 1200 so faculty: student ratio is very low.So you have to be very disciplined and hardworking if you choose this college because the teacher does not have time to take classes and you have to complete the bulk of the syllabus on your own. The teachers here are highly qualified and their teaching method is also up to the mark. There are four internal exams altogether one every month and two practicals in middle and before the end of the semester. It is not difficult to pass if you are sincere and dedicated to your studies but as I mentioned earlier that as the number of teachers is very less so they are not able to take your class regularly.In that case, you have to plan yourself accordingly and start studying hard and don't keep anything pending at last week before your semester exam."

Coming to the faculty and student ratio we have 300 technical and nontechnical faculty and the students are approximately 1500 so faculty can easily focus on every student. comin to the qualification of the faculty in our department we have 6 phd completed faculty and all the teachers are completed their M.tech in their respective fields and coming to nonteaching faculty few completed their Btech for their job role.
coming to term exams we need to write 2 term exams in our semester for this our faculty always they will come up with a plan after completion of every unit they will conduct quiz and few test exams along with assignment and they also make us present the lesson so that we can improve our presentation skills. and it will be easy if we are ready"

SUMAN GARAI,Ramkrishna Mahato Government Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.0,Honest Review of my College,"I had chosen Cse because I was always enthusiastic about coding since my 10th standard so I decided to make my career in this itself.There are 30-35 teachers in this college and students are around 1200 so faculty: student ratio is very low.So you have to be very disciplined and hardworking if you choose this college because the teacher does not have time to take classes and you have to complete the bulk of the syllabus on your own. The teachers here are highly qualified and their teaching method is also up to the mark. There are four internal exams altogether one every month and two practicals in middle and before the end of the semester. It is not difficult to pass if you are sincere and dedicated to your studies but as I mentioned earlier that as the number of teachers is very less so they are not able to take your class regularly.In that case, you have to plan yourself accordingly and start studying hard and don't keep anything pending at last week before your semester exam."

coming to term exams we need to write 2 term exams in our semester for this our faculty always they will come up with a plan after completion of every unit they will conduct quiz and few test exams along with assignment and they also make us present the lesson so that we can improve our presentation skills. and it will be easy if we are ready"

They all are well qualified and their teaching method is good, they sort all your problems if you face any problem in any of the subject. Every 2 months, we have our monthly exams and they are difficult too. So that we can prepare for our main University exams."

Student (Anonymous),Shri Vaishnav Institute of Management - [SVIM],"BBA, General",7.7,"This college had a greate experience, As it was runnning since 1987 and it is great college.","The expenses approaches are great, at negligible charges the schooling is truly brilliant. The expense of the review is 40000 for a year and 120000 for the entire BBA and DAVV charges 4000 for the assessment structure which thoroughly costs 144000rs. Which is truly insignificant with the best training quality in Indore. I'm getting an ex-understudy grant as I have done graduation from this school. The ST/SC understudies got their yearly grant in the school. Understudies got standard updates for entry-level positions and occupations which is extremely subjective and more with openness."

MAUSOOMI  ROY,Indore Institute of Science and Technology - [IIST],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",10.0,,"When it comes to choosing a course I believe it's a personal preference, based on our interests and skills. I had taken PCM in my 11th standard so that I could pursue a B.Tech degree in the future in the computer science branch. During my visit to the college, I was given a thorough knowledge as to what exactly is engineering and what am I going to learn here. Not only the faculty briefed me about the branch that I was interested in i.e. CS but also the other branches in engineering so that I was sure before taking a step further.
Currently, we have 3 batches for the CS branch with a 70:1 student teacher ratio. The faculty is highly qualified and their teaching methods are also very efficient. 
In a semester we have 2 MSTs (mid-sem tests) and at the end of the sem, we have our end sem exams and viva. Passing an examination is not hard if you study well enough for it, which is what the faculty focuses on."
