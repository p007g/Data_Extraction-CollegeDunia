Student (Anonymous),Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.2,Most genuine Review from a DCE(now DTU) Student.,"Frankly, I chose this course becoz of rank and also ECE is best after tech branches and I didn't want to go into tech branches. The best thing is we have 3 paths ie core, tech, and a consultancy where big 4 companies like Deloitte also recruit.
The faculty-student ratio is around 1:96 and it becomes around 1:68 in further years.
All professors are highly qualified and publish many research papers every year still Frankly all professors are not good, those old ones who are bored of teaching the same subject for years are also there, PHD scholars who are their assistants are generally enthusiastic in teaching since they have more energy and realte to students problems,
The course curriculum is quite relevant to today's industry needs. 
The difficulty level is relatively less as compared to iit's bcoz the curriculum is relatively lighter and also all the students are not top rankers and got admission due to state domicile. So it is best for those who just want to find out his/her passion, will get exposure."

I choose NIMS university for physiotherapy as its fee structure is quite low as compared to other private colleges and also it has a super speciality hospital with a great patient flow which is necessary for medical students.
The faculty here are good. In the physiotherapy department, all faculties are mpt or Phds.

Their teaching method involves smart classes for theory and practical labs and Dissection Hall for practicals.

1:10. The qualification of teachers is very good they are alumni of IITs and other top government institutions and they have plenty of good knowledge and the method of delivering that knowledge is very good.
Term exams are in 2 parts 
Mid sem- comes after 2 months of starting a semester they are like 25 or 20 marks and a bit easier to score in them.
End sem- Yeah here they check your speed and patience both at the same time. Your collection of words should be good in the answer sheet to score more. 
This consists of 50 marks and by studying for a week you can score good marks and if you want to be a topper you have to be consistent in your studies.

All faculty have done their masters and some are pursuing higher studies like Ph.D. Some teachers are good some are bad at teaching but they all are good in nature there are exceptions. Term exam time was a high-pressure time but if you study normally throughout the sem then the exam would be a piece of cake for you. And faculty will help you if you do not do good in your exam.

Venna Raghunatha Reddy,Aurora's Degree College,"B.Sc, Computer Science",9.0,Aurorian Review,"In this college fee structure is some what high but the standards will be maintained accordingly. When I was studied it was around 39000 for first year and the fee will be raised every year l, as I remembered I paid around 47000 in my last year. So I paid nearly one lakh twenty thousand for my entire degree to complete but it will be worthwhile if you use the resources properly like library, placement assistance etc.. I got internship offer from the company Sutherland in my last year but I didn't join because of my personal reasons. Our college is collaborated with big companies like Deloitte, Sutherland,Tech Mahindra, TCs and many more. They also provide CRT classes to give you the placement assistance and thus it's easy to get the job if you use all the resources properly here. Coming to scholarships it won't provide any such but may be they will accept student who get scholarship from Governments. I don't have much idea about scholarships as I was not eligible I never enquired."

The faculty is good but a few of the faculty despite being knowledgeable and sometimes fail to deliver the exact knowledge.
Otherwise, every faculty is qualified more than enough.
For each semester there are 3 assignments with 10 marks each, 2 class tests with 30 marks each, and a pre-University exam with 100 marks, and then the university exam with 100 marks.
Every exam is not very difficult to pass."

Rudra Narayan Das,C. V. Raman Global University,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.6,Okay okay college. Not like KIIT or ITER.

Shaik Mohammed Asif Ali,Rajeev Gandhi Memorial College of Engineering and Technology Nandyal - [RGMCET],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",7.8,My College My Experiences.,"I chose Civil Engineering as I was quite interested in the particular course and also because of government job opportunities.
The faculty: student ratio is Around 20-25 faculty 160 students. The minimum qualification for teaching is Mtech and for lab assistants it is btech. The college will follow its own regulations in terms of teaching. Both practical and theory related will be in the same semester for a better understanding of subjects. There will be two-semester which have 1 External exam, and 2 internals exams, the first internal be held with 2 and half months start of the course and the next before the start of the external exams of the semester. The external exam will be at the end of one semester which has 6 months duration.

Aryan Vishwakarma,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",6.0,NIT Agartala pros and cons,"So I like some branches out of which electrical was the one, but however, I got this branch in the JOSAA counselling. And the faculties are not very much support if you are planning to prepare for some other exams, but with respect to the subjects (course subjects), faculties will help you, not all the faculty but there will be some faculty who will help you.
Student ratio: the student ratio of my department is more towards the boy side, i.e. if a class has 40 boys then there would be 20 girls. 
For each year there will be 2 semesters, and each semester has mid-semester exams and end-semester exams. So overall in a year, you will have two mid-sem and two end-sem.
And preparation, if I would tell you, is very easy if you even sincerely study just two-three days before the exam you can easily score a very good score."

The students become eligible for campus placements from the 5-6th semester onwards, starting from the internships to the placements in the 7-8th semester.
The highest package offered this year was 62 lakhs per annum with an average of 8.5 lakhs per annum.
