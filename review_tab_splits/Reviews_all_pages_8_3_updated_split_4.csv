Kushagra Gupta,Galgotias University - [GU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.8,Galgotias University from an eye of an average student,"It's a mixed experience, the faculty is fine... It's a mix breed, some teachers are good whole some aren't, for most of the times the faculty is nice though college management sucks bad, the faculty student ratio should be i guess 1:80 or so, the teachers are well qualified and they do take feedback for the teachers to ensure that the teachers do their jobs properly, the exams are really annoying here, ever since the new pattern we have monthly exams so every month we waste 1 week for exams, the exams are really easy to pass, if you listen to what the teacher is teaching in the class and follow them closely you can score good marks though since it's a university where the teachers check the copies instead of an external teacher, in case of an argument between student and teacher cause of which bad blood arise between the duo, the student can suffer fire consequences so beware of that. As far as it goes for why I chose this course well... At first i thought it was my passion but now idk"
