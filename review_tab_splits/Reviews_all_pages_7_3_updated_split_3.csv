Utkarsh Shukla,IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],,5.7,Review of IIT Madras online degree BSC Program in Programming and Data Science,"As it is an online degree program so there is nothing to be called as groups clubs sports or anything.
Look now the worst part of this program comes where student interactions and the feel of being in a group where you can have fun are absent. There is no such type of relevant group. although IIT made several clubs in reality, it's worth nothing this program, is very good if you are a student or professional who is doing a course outside and have a social presence outside but if you are only doing this course then you are being left alone.
In the name of Techfest, there recently organized a fest wish you have to attend an IIT Madras this is an online program so you have to draw travel for 3 days from wherever you are and these three days you have to pay all the charges it's like if you are born with a silver spoon then you can afford it."

The teaching method is quite traditional and satisfactory and smart lecture rooms are available. After all, you have to study on your own from the textbooks and notes provided by seniors.

The ratio between faculty and the student was 1:45.The visiting and inhouse faculty are erudite and stalwarts of their industry and they provide the best industry insight into their specific field.
The exams were held timely and the difficulty level was moderate and your level of preparation."

We have different faculties in different subjects, so don't feel we don't have enough faculties.
Some faculties are well qualified such as - they have done B.Tech/M.Tech or BCA/MCA degrees from reputed institutions. They have good teaching experience in their fields. Also, they are of helping nature and kind-hearted, also some teachers are strict which is obvious and normal. Sometimes they will motivate you so that you can't get distracted from your future path. Sometimes they make you laugh. Their teaching method is also good and simple so that you can understand it better.
Generally, they use their native language during class so that your topic must be cleared.
Tests and exams are taken regularly here, like monthly tests, assignments, pre-university tests, end-term exams and lab practicals and much more."

Now, the government came up with Jagananna Schemes so we don't need to mind college tuition fees because it's affordable through fee reimbursement. Twenty thousand rupees are given for staying in the college attached hostel and this is called the Jagananna Vasathi Deevena scheme. Stipends are given to us because some companies give that offer. But the con is that we don't get many internships in reality."

The course is structured in a proper way but it would be helpful if they updated the curriculum.
The course is structured in a way that students can have a proper understanding of the subject.
The student-to-faculty ratio is approx 40:1."
SRISHTI MISHRA,Banaras Hindu University - [BHU],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Agriculture",7.4,Genuine words.,"The curriculum is very well defined and the students are provided with the full syllabus of the whole curriculum beforehand. The professors stick to those topics.
The faculty students are around 20:1 and the ratio even becomes better if we include the PhD scholars under this. We get to interact with them and they are of helpful attitude. Each and every faculty is a PhD holder in their respective streams. Teaching methods vary among them. Few of the just come and talk and we note the important points down. Many of them come with some slides and presentations and explain the topic according to the points mentioned in the slides, which I think is the best method of teaching. Exams happen in time. The syllabus and classes are planned accordingly. The difficulty level of the paper is not that much. If the student has attended all the classes, he/she can score well in the examination. In a nutshell, the questions don't come out of what is being taught in the class. This motivates us to be regular."

Student (Anonymous),Dr Ambedkar College,"BCA, General",7.0,All about my graduation,"Most of the students can apply for placement in the last sem of the degree. Companies such as TCS, Infosys, and Deloitte, came for on-campus placement and around 40-50% of students got placed. The highest package offered was 3.5 LPA by Deloitte and whereas Lowest offered was 1.9 LPA  by TCS.

Faculty student ratio is quite well and it depends upon the branch
Most of the faculty are Post-Graduates and PHD holders and most of the post-Graduates are pursuing PHD.


Teaching method again depends upon the faculty and it varies from one to another but mostly well qualified staff and good teaching has been maintained.


Term exams and frequent and we've to give after every 3 months and it's not that difficult to clear them."
