So after doing this I want to pursue a doctorate degree.
Teacher student ratio in this course is 1:60
In this college, there are both permanent faculty and guest faculty. Permanent faculty has better teaching skills than the guest faculty because the majority of them are students who pursue doctorate degrees under the guidance of this college's Professors. They generally lack experience.
The teaching method is excellent for permanent faculty.
Exams are held timely. One is held in the month of December and the other in May. There are four semesters in this course. The paper level is difficult. One needs a descriptive knowledge of the subject to score good marks in examinations. Previous year papers can provide a lot of help."

Student (Anonymous),Government Polytechnic Arvi - [GPA],"Polytechnic, Computer Engineering",6.0,Internships are not offered  by College,"Computer science is the only branch I'd ever wanted.
Faculty do some kind of partiality when it comes to internal grading and marking even though you have a good scoring record and you do mess up with any faculty consider that subject teacher will mostly give you low marks for internal grading and that can lead to ATKT or F.T(Failure Term).
The faculty is really good and supportive and they know to clear your doubts and queries. 
Exams were on time like class tests, internal practical exams, and external practical exams as per the MSBTE schedule.
If the college doesn't teach you a certain topic in class that doesn't mean it'll not come in your exam as per the MSBTE paper it can give you a bit of shock in the exam hall."

No matter what, electrical is the only option my mind will accept. Coming to the faculty-student ratio, it doesn't matter as far as the class is interesting (electrical as always is), engaging and lively. Teaching methods of faculty cannot be generalized as the faculty teach using different methods and all of it can't be categorized into one, yes there are few boring ones, but the important subjects are given to the best faculty. Hence the problem is solved. But, it's too much to take all the faculty into one place, as every human being has their own potential and methods. Tey, the improvement can be done by taking honest reviews anonymously from trustworthy students. It will be too much to comment on exams as it is completely dependent on JNTUH. Our college has very negligible authority to change the exam pattern or what so ever. Since it is an autonomous institution, the difficulty was slightly on the lesser side."

I don't hear about any group or club being run by students in our department. 
Sports activities were never organized by our department. 
In the name of extracurricular activities, we used to celebrate teachers' day and some quiz competitions and seminars nothing else.

Inbisat Anjum,Aliah University,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Biological Science",8.3,Aliah University - An Institution that needs to be appreciated and brought out to the mainstream.,"I wanted to pursue research, and the past few years with peak COVID made me interested in Microbiology. 
The student: faculty ratio is roughly 1:20. There are near about 60 seats in total in the Biological Sciences department. Out of this, based on merit, the students are dived equally into 3 hons subjects - Zoology, Botany and Microbiology. The classes are not chaotic at all and are easy to manage. 

The faculty of the Department of Biological Sciences are all excellent. Needless to say, all of them have a PhD in their respective fields and every interaction with them would teach you a lot of things about the subject. In UG courses, for the first 2-3 semesters at least, most classes are taken by research scholars of the university, who are very frank and friendly with the students. They treat you like their juniors in all essence. Most of them rely on teaching the classes via PPT slides combined with using green board as and when required."
