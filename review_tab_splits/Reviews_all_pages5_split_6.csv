The faculty is pretty experienced and very good at its job . I guess almost every student quite like the way they are teaching. Exams are held regularly, for times I thought every week has an exam. University takes 20-30 exams every semester excluding practicals, viva, etc. the difficulty levels vary from exam to exam for example- End term exams are more difficult than monthly-based exams, etc but overall if you are studying regularly it's quite easy to pass all subjects. Extra classes or doubt sessions are also held after the completion of the syllabus to ensure students get the proper knowledge to score higher."

Moksh Kalra,Lady Shri Ram College for Women - [LSR],"BA {Hons.}, Economics",8.0,2 MONTHS AT LSR,"Since NEP-2020 policy is applicable to us, I would go through the Research which will be offered to us in the fourth year after completing graduation. Placement cell is active in the college as it provides various internships and placements of different sectors to the students studying in any year. Virtual, part time or full time internships and jobs are there. Full time is generally do-able in the months of May and June(in semester break). Mainly jobs are from private or corporate sector. One should take care of the attendance criteria also before applying to the internship in which they are wishing to join. University or college won't entertain any such thing. Internship policy covering every aspect is provided by the college. Students in humanities courses have relatively more chances of getting job opportunities in comparison to commerce and science stream."

I have been very lucky to be exposed to professors who have been a delight to study under. The professors are industry professionals from companies like HSBC, Zydus, Standard Chartered, HUL . 
Most of our professors are PhDs and those who aren't are from the Industry. 
There are 6 terms. It is not hard to pass but needs a lot of hard work. I got more than 9 GPA in the 1st term but I had to pull all-nighters. It depends on the person and what they prioritize. People who are very active in their clubs also get great jobs and can get better packages than high rankers. It all depends on how we carry ourselves and how much we wish to learn. IMT helps you grow as an Individual."

As I'm interested in programming I've chosen this course. The faculty-student ratio is 1:25. Faculty members are not at all experienced in teaching us the subjects. They don't have that knowledge or experience of the curriculum. Most of the faculty members are comfortable in only one domain and when asked to teach other subjects they're no good at all. While some of them just show all the contents through slides using PPT and get over it. There's an end-semester exam for every 5 months divided into 2 semesters."

The student-faculty ratio is about 1:8, you can find so many phD Holders taking tutorials classes formally but they don't even come to class not even for attendance.
All the faculties here are PhD holders and one of the best in their field and most of them have done PhD from REC Kurukshetra (NIT KKR) Itself, especially the old ones. Their teaching method is not so modern but very classy, they just stick to the syllabus and not to the industrial exposure also they didn't give any attention whether you are studying or playing Games in class they just need your attendance otherwise they will detain you.
Term exams are held on a uniform basis every month we can say. As there is a semester of 4-5 months, you have to give 2 Mid-semester exams and One end sem exam and the overall CGPA depends on both of these scores. You can easily pass the exam but for scoring well you have to study really hard coz they didn't give you marks but will pass easily."
