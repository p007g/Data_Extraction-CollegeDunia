But as our family's financial condition is not that high and there is no financial growth in physics I have opted for the Tech branch(MnC). (despite all these problems I will take a minor in physics in BTech and do a major in MTech) Now I chose mathematics and computing because along with financial growth I want to continue atleast one subject which I learnt till now from start i.e maths (at least something of not physics).
Coming to faculty: the student ratio, it's very good, there are many profs available for us and if you leave about profs there will be 1 TA( teaching assistant) for each and every subject for just 20 students ( and expecting more than this is too much)
All the profs are very very experienced and very friendly (most of them are like ""just chill"") and when it comes to our math prof kV sir, he's like he has eaten up the whole real analysis"

The librarian is a little bit arrogant they do not talk to the student in a very proper manner so we avoid going to the library for taking books and make notes.
I talk about the amenities in the classroom so the class board is good and the fan condition is also good.

Farhan Khan Pathan,VIT Bhopal University,"B.Tech, Bioengineering",9.7,VIT Bhopal University review with Farhan,"Generally, students who secure good ranks in VITEEE entrance examination, those are eligible for the scholarship benefits offered by VIT Bhopal university. Basically fees hike in VIT varies according to the rank of the students, students who do not secure good rank, fees structure of those students little bit higher but it depends on the course choices, if you want to take admission in Computer Science and Engineering then it is pretty much obvious that your fees will be somewhat higher then other branches, If you secure good rank in VITEEE than you can be eligible for the 100% scholarship on your tuition fees, which is given under some conditions like your CGPA should be higher and equal to 9 in each semester for further continuation of the scholarship apart from this VIT also offers financial assistance for the lower income students, VIT Bhopal offers STARS scholarship for the rural students of Madhya Pradesh, Who secure 1st position in their district from the government schools."

HIMANSHU GUPTA,Malaviya National Institute of Technology - [MNIT],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",8.0,EXCITING JOURNEY,"I have chosen this course because this was the best option I was getting from my rank.
Faculty to student ratio is approx  120/30, which is equal to 4.
The qualifications of faculty members are quite good, as they all have done their Ph.D.
But some of the tutorials which are not taken by the professors are taken by the ph.D. Scholars of mnit Jaipur, who are completing their degree. The style of teaching or we can say the teaching methods are not up to the mark.
Due to corona, the first three semesters were for three months only but from 4th semester, it will be a duration of 6months.
It was not so difficult to pass the semester exams.
It ca be managed to pass the exams after studying 7 days before the exams."

And also nowadays the field and opportunities in electronics are very high. in the first year, we have 32 students, and a working day is divided into 5 periods. 6 subjects and 8 facilities in the first year.

The first sem is easy when compared to others but when we take this subject seriously we will understand everything. The difficulty depends upon your likes and dislikes in the subject. The faculties always try their best to make us better."
