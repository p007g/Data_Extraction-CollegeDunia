Dipesh Kumar,Chouksey Engineering College - [CEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.5,My college experience at Chouksey engineering college,"3rd years students are eligible to appear in interviews. I found often service-based companies come to recruit students. The companies like Buyjus, just dial, collabrra, etc. The average package of the college is 200k and the highest is 1200k that they say but 1000k is the highest but that happens rarely. 20% of students get placed. After completion of this degree, I have a plan for off-campus."

Subhanshu Sood,Panjab University - [PU],"BHMCT,",8.6,Hotel management in Panjab University,"From the start, I had a passion for traveling and working together so this course offers me different jobs in different countries so I can wander and earn at the same time. The faculty is very good, and cooperative they are always there to help! In my batch, there are 57 students so the faculty gives attention to everyone. Teachers have vast experience in their field as some have done jobs for 10 years in that same field they are teaching so you not only get bookish knowledge but also practical experience with it. Exams are always on time and it is not at all tough to pass it's just some basic knowledge about your course and a little bit of studying this can pass you easily."
RACHIT GUPTA,Vikram University - [VU],"BCA, General",9.3,Best ever university,"The timings of this university are student-friendly and also students can manage their curriculum and other activities simultaneously. There is no as such strict restrictions regarding fixed attendance throughout the academic session it's totally depends on students. The faculty is very good as they summarize each and every concept very clearly and deliver new skills to students. BCA department faculty is very supportive and helps students to manipulate their skill sets and prefers the right and full roadmap for them to get success in their field. So last, I want to say that the best college affiliated with Vikram university is good and helps students to develop their skills and get hired by top mnc companies. Overall I just want to say students to take admission to any course at this University without hesitation. Here faculty to student ratio is 2:1 which means a lot for a university to have this ratio also good qualified staff and faculty are provided by the Vikram university so better."

The faculties are very good support and well qualified most of the teachers are professors means they had done PHD in their respective fields and recently some of the teachers are featured in the top two per cent scientists in the world. Faculty to student ratio is good such that in our lab class there are three teachers present in the lab of 45 students and at least there are two teachers per subject you can clear your doubts with them whenever you want they provide you with full support. I think passing the exam is a little bit difficult there are two sessional exams and one end sem exam per semester syllabus is a little bit difficult so you have to put in your efforts to pass the exam.

Surya,Sai Vidya Institute of Technology - [SVIT],"BE, Information Science & Engineering",5.4,Review of an average student,"Usually, the college starts the placement training and finishes it before the 6th semester but this time they started it in the middle of the 6th semester. So the students become eligible for placement from the 7th semester.
Only 6 companies have come for placements. The companies that came are TSC, HEXAWARE, TECH-MAHINDRA, HPE, and some others companies, The college has got 3 internship companies as well.
The highest package made was 10.2 CTC, the lowest was 1.5LPA and the average package is 2.5LPA.

The faculty members of our department are good and supportive. Till now they are able to solve almost my all problems regarding subject topics. They are also available after classes, we can meet them in the faculty room and solve our doubts after class hours. They are also very supportive regarding anything you share with them. If you take any initiative or any good decision they are always with you. The faculty-to-student ratio is almost 1:10. All the faculty members are Mtech or Phd qualified. Some of them are also IITians. But sometimes they behave limited rudely & also give some extra pressure regarding academics. There are 4 CAs taken each semester, among them, 2 are written tests & other 2 are assignments. If you attend classes regularly you can pass them if you can't pass the exam, retests are arranged for improvement."

Faculty to Student Ratio - I don't exactly know but I guess its somewhat 1:50 which is considered pretty bad but I never felt a lack of attention or guidance from the faculties
Most of the Faculties are Doctorate Holders
And even the Lab assistants are Doctorate Aspirants. All Teacher's Notes are provided on their Official Student Site VTOP.
Teaching methods vary from teacher to teacher but most of the times its good.
There are 3 exams - CAT 1, CAT 2 and FAT.
There is an exam after every 5-6 weeks of classes.
CAT 2 is open book
Other Exams are Close Book
None of the exams are very tough to pass.
But we need to understand that passing is never an issue. Main aim should be getting good grades. Getting S Grade is quite tough."

I don't know correctly about the salary package I think that the average salary package is 5lakh/annum. To get a job after completing this degree you have to learn a skill based on software development. Then you can get a job easily after completing the course. I am studying android development and I want to become an app developer after completing this degree.

The student ratio is a bit off balance because I am CSE Student so boys to girl ratio are a bit off like 1:5 but in some batches, you will also get the inverse of this because of the course you choose.
Qualification of teachers are from PhD. to B.Sc. it varies from field to field and their teaching method is excellent some teacher uses real-life example and some uses digital method to make you understand the concept.

1. Can you manage ur time and prioritise your work?
2. You have to do many things on your own without having any environment around you.
On the other hand faculty members are very supportive but again if you want to be on top then you have to hustle on your own. And come forward to achieve opportunities to be on top.
Faculty members are mostly the PhD scholars of IITs, they have a good amount of knowledge of what they are teaching you. But again being a private institution each professor have 2 -3 subjects to teach to a different year of students and yes student-teacher ratio is pretty decent."

GANTA THARUN,Institute of Aeronautical Engineering - [IARE],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",9.3,STUDENT WITH ECO-FRIENDLY COLLEGE,"The fee is normal to pay every student who came from emcet. The government provides 35000 to us. Due to corona, we lost my scholarship and it is reduced to low. They will provide placement training for campus drives. For that, they will take 30000 fees from each head. They will provide training classes and they will teach programming skills and English skills and database management systems. As per the student's view, it is to take the course as a benefit to place on the campus with a job."

Amrutha t madihalli,BMS Institute of Technology and Management - [BMSIT],"BE, Information Science & Engineering",7.8,BMSIT honest review,"About the fest, because of the lockdown in previous years, it was conducted online. 
But this year they conducted it officially. 
It was really a good experience. 
Clubs are not many and not many people found them interesting. 
The sports and NCC are also provided with a good opportunity."
DINESH BALIVADA,The National Institute of Engineering - [NIE],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.7,IT IS BEST,"There are quite a few active clubs in the college but none of them have any funding. They have the freedom to conduct any event.
A few of the interesting clubs can be CreditCircle which is a financial club, GFG which is all about coding and computer science related, and also there are robotics and other mechanical clubs.
The good thing about this college is that the library is really rich in books. Apart from academic books, the library is replenished with all sorts of books including novels and journals.
There is active participation in sports with team selections in every sport possible.
There will be an intercollege sports meet every even semester.
There will be one fest conducted every even semester which to be honest is so bad that no one attends.
There is very little funding for the fests and there will be no enjoyment. A better plan is to enjoy yourself by going on trips.
There is no campus, by the way, there is one boy's hostel, and one girl's hostel admin block which has labs, and classes."
Koppula manoj,Malla Reddy Engineering College - [MREC],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.2,This is my real opinion,"There are not been much of any fest happened since I came to this college because of COVID-19.
