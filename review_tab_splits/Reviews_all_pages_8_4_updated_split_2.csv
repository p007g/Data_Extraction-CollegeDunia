Prachi das,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.2,College- da- review,"I believe placement  opportunities for mechanical branch are very high in NIT JAMSHEDPUR. Thats why I chose mechanical here. Faculty ratio is quiet good. I mean we dont have to face any issue during online classes. teachers are always available. Most of the faculty members are Phd passouts from IIT KHARAGPUR, So i must say they are quiet good at their subject matter. They can explain your doubt anywhere, anytime. I like there gesture too.  There are two exams in each semester, mid semester with half of the syllabus, and end semester with full syllabus. Plus we have viva from practicals in the end. Question papers and marking scheme seem very tricky and its difficukt to obtain full marks in each subjects. But where there is a will, there is a way."

Kinjal Selot,Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology - [SVNIT],"B.Tech, Chemical Engineering",7.5,The SVNIT chemical review by a second year tie,"SVNIT organizes many fests throughout the year. So naming one is hard. Recently we celebrated ""Umang"" with the theme ""Aazadi ka amrit mohotsav"" and a cultural fest is ongoing right now on the occasion of ""Mahashivratri"". The central library is located on the campus and it has many books but I believe they should add more fictional novels as they're also important for students' mental health. Classrooms are large, bright with a proper air supply. Sports and extra currículars are also taken care of really well. And there are many clubs both cultural and technical. They have their own websites and Instagram handles too."

So there are about ratio of 1:3 teacher to student ratio
*Faculties are very qualified and experienced teachers some are from Nits and other are having experience of teaching for byjus , akash so facilities is good as they try to explain concept on basis of tricks and by showing it practically.
*Exam were very timely two semesters per year one in month of August and other in December and exam were quite difficult as HODS use to set the questions paper"

Poonam,Indira Gandhi National Open University - [IGNOU],"M.A, English",6.3,Best option if you want to learn while working in office,"I am fond of reading English novels and poems, so masters in English suits best. This course is part time, so can focus on my job too. As far as academics is concerned, you need to self study and you can rely on teachers because classes are provided only on weekend basis and it is not feasible for a teacher to cover the whole syllabus in detail. they just can guide us. All study is needed to be done by the students themselves. Marks are allocated on the basis of assignment of 30 marks and semester examinations of 70 marks. exams are not being conducted on scheduled timing from 2 years. also this session's examination is yet to be done. and we just have to wait dor for date sheet and hall tickets. Getting goods marks is very difficult task because hardly any teacher reads our answer scripts thoroughly. This may boon for some students but not for those who Study with dedication."

The faculty is student ratio is also quite decent with one faculty per around 40 students. The faculties are all MBAs and Ph.D. holders and have an amazing experience in their respective backgrounds.
Exams happened on time and in an efficient manner. Exams are designed in a manner where understanding of the concepts is tested and not just rote learning. Exams are of good standard yet decent enough to pass if one has understood the concepts well."
BHAVISH SANGHVI,IMT Ghaziabad,"PG Diploma, Banking And Financial Services",9.0,College review,"The fees are quite reasonable. For an MBA one does have to shell out a large sum relative to other postgraduate qualifications. But keeping that in mind, compared to other MBA colleges, the fees are quite affordable.
There are a couple of student loans that are offered for students who can't afford the fees of the college. The average placement package is Rs. 15,00,000. 
So a 1-year salary would mostly cover the loan amount. 
The ROI is beyond reproach."
