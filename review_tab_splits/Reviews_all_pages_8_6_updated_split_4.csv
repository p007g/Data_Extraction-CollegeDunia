In our department, there were around 30 students only. And we had 5 professors. All of them are good. Our head of the department professor was excellent. And our principal was also a physics professor.

The student-faculty ratio was 1 professor per 6 students. We had to do a lot of practical classes in 3 years. Our professor used to do a lot of practical classes. And we used to do seminars in our department where everyone participate in audiovisual studies.

All of our professors have done Ph.D. and they were very helpful.

We had to give one final exam every year but our professors did take a lot of class tests and they provided a lot of mock question papers.
