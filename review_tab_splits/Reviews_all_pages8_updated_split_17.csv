Student-teacher ratio is around 75. In my class there are 75 students like most of the class as I have confirmed from some of my friends.
Most of the teachers here are highly qualified having a ton of experience, some of the teachers are teaching from past 30-35 years. Teaching methods are somewhat traditional and somewhat modern, mix of both. They use good amount of technologies to teach the students. For term exams, since I am still in 1st semester, so, there have not been term tests till now. But as my seniors have told me about exams, they are not considered, that much hard to pass."

There aren't any scholarships that I know of but yes there are aids for students facing a financial crisis. You can avail of the services once you've taken the admission. You have to fill a form and provide some documents and once it's verified, you'll get the assistance.
This college doesn't promise you a job. But if you are smart enough to score and get into Miranda House then trust me you'll get a good job for sure. There are internships. (I think they're non-paid. Since it's just for the experience that you need for your future.)

After all these B.tech in biotech is a much better course for a bio student as nowadays B.sc. Ag. has already started to get a rush in this stream of students and very soon the opportunities will decline. So, that why i choose BTech in Biotechnology .

Faculty and student ratio is also good because a lot of faculty are there to help you in your academics.


Most of the Faculty members are highly qualified and thier teaching method is also so good,they give priority to the practical knowledge rather than just talking about the books.

Term exams are also timely and if u have been studying a little but continuosly than you will pass the examination easily."

The only best time when you can do anything in this college is Fest time. The fest 'TATVA' happens every year in the month of March and one more day 'Ethnic day' also celebrated like a festival here. Sports activities, cultural activities, trekking are all part of extracurricular activities.Every branch has their own club."
Student (Anonymous),Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.2/10,A review of JECRC by a JECRCian,"For placements students become eligible at the end of the 3rd year before this student have to can do an internship in different companies. 
In this college, many good companies come like TCS, Accenture, HP, Google, Microsoft and many other reputed companies. The highest package was Rs44 lpa given by Amazon to a student and HP hired 11 students with the package of Rs 11 LPA. 
College helps very much in placement activities. Students with less percentage are even placed with the package of Rs 3 LPA. 
Computer science has almost 100% placements as compared to other branches. For good placements, students have to be good in the coding part, data structure and algorithm, C language and any other language they know. Before placements, training is given to all the students on how to present themselves in placement interviews. But this is helpful to only some extent. 
After B.tech if I get placed with a good package then I will do that job otherwise I will go with M.tech in computer science"
Student (Anonymous),L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Information Technology",7.2/10,One of the best engineering college in gujrat,"I was interested in the computer science field but due to my low ranking I got information technology, I am happy because there is no difference between CSE and IT. Faculty to student ratio is decent not too good & not too bad. Teachers are qualified from reputed institutes & most of them are Ph.D., but teaching style is decent, some teachers are really good while some are really bad, the main issue is the old syllabus and old methods of teaching in all engineering colleges in India. Exams are taken in 2 phases in the semester.
1. mid sem exam
2. end sem exam 
The difficulty of exams depends on faculty some, exams are easy while others are extremely lengthy and tough too."
Ayush Kumar,Dronacharya Group of Institutions - [DGI],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.8/10,Excellent college for studies,"Fees of the college
1st year= 93800(academic fee),5000(security fee which is refundable after your completion of course)
2,3,4,year= 93800
There are university fees which are paid by students every year and it is 7800.
In my college, the placement opportunity is excellent because you can sit in 4 to 5 companies exams and interviews and it gives us more opportunities to get placed in a good company at the good package.
We get the scholarship by up government every year of rs 50000."
Rudani Gautamkumar kantibhai,L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Information Technology",7.5/10,My College Review,"our college placement is very high.

Ashish Pandey,Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Sciences - [SHUATS],"MBA, Agribusiness",9.0/10,SHUATS Reviews,The campus life of the college is good. the cultural fest and the college also celebrate the festivals which is the main attraction point for students. Sports activities and competitions are also held in the college. Xpression is a 3-day cultural fest which is organized by the college. The library is full of books the only drawback of the books in the library is that most of the books in the library are outdated.
Student (Anonymous),Satyug Darshan Institute of Engineering & Technology - [SDIET],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.0/10,Good for middle class family,Extraordinary faculty present with very Frank nature. They resolve each and every doubt of students very calmly. I choose this course because I have seen good scope in this field.

Suman Raheja,Katni Arts and Commerce College - [KACC],"B.Com, Taxation",6.0/10,Best collage is KACC,"There are many functions that are connected in our college. For example, freshers' party, farewell party, Janmashtami celebrations, Ganesh Chaturthi, and many more these all programs are connected and managed by our teachers and senior students of college all management are excellent and students are charged a certain amount which is relevant and affordable for every student. In the case of the library, many books are not available for the students who are not purchased from the market they expect to issue books from the library but because of no availability of books, they have to purchase new ones from the market. And library pass is also generated from college for students to issue books. Our collage page is on many social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Linkin and many more where many students are connected and it's a very helpful service which is provided by the college where a student can contact them and clear their doubts in any problem in any formalities regarding college."

Student (Anonymous),Kishan Lal Public College,"BBA, General",7.0/10,College Review,"I choose this course because I have an immense interest in business studies And I also want to pursue MBA further so this course is the ideal one for me.
There are more than 40 faculties available in my department  and students in my class are around 45 
Well, some of the teachers are extremely good while some are not. honestly speaking every teacher's aim is to finish the syllabus as soon as possible and yes some teachers teach you very good but their primary goal is to complete the syllabus as soon as possible so I personally believe this syllabus or theory-based approach is not soo good for management students.
Exams are conducted semester-wise. First semester exams are usually conducted in February- march or the second semester in july -august. The exam pattern changes every year like there is always a compulsory question and 8 more questions from which you have to attempt only 4. do from 9 questions you have to do 5 questions for 80 marks.
paper is moderate and questions come from the syllabus."

Faculty: 
I’m just writing about my course rest I don’t know much about there faculties and classes we don’t have any faculty except Accounts subject because of no faculty they never conducted any class for other subjects like economics, business management, business law, company law, etc. 
Student ratio: 
Students for the particular course are high but the class size is small it never matters just because they never conducted any classes.
Qualification of teacher: 
They are not experienced they keep writing the same question again and again not going to clear your any doubt they don’t have much knowledge about. 
Term exams are conducted but no students agree to give any of the exams but who have given they don’t give any result of that it is conducted for formality."
