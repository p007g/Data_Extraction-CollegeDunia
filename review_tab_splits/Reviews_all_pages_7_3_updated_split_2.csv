I choose BCA because it opens up various paths as I belong to the commerce stream and according to old people we only have two options either going for CA or becoming a bank manager. But no, it's not like that, by doing BCA we can apply for bank manager by pursuing masters, go for various government jobs, and guess what we can also go to MNCs and become software engineers as well, and there are more opportunities which we can explore during the course. 
There are 6 semesters in 3 years and the subject level is upgraded every semester."

All faculty who are handling Masters are from IITs and Phd holders with an experience of more than 25 years. I feel very lucky to get guidance from those faculty who are having in-depth knowledge in the subject as well as practical experience. All teachers expect students have more practical knowledge along with a strong theoretical base, hence the coach was like that only.
class strength was 18 and 5 teachers were there to handle subjects along with the Lab instructor. separate mini projects will be given to the students to assess the student's knowledge and understating of the subjects.
There are 2 internal were there and semester exams per semester. A total of 4 semesters will be there in two years. In 3 rd and 4th-semester intership and Final project will be taken care of."

The faculty student ratio is quite good.
For every 8 to 10 students you can expect one faculty. 

Faculties are quite educated. They have decent knowledge in the particular subject that they teach to the students. They try their best to keep the students attached to the subjects they teach. Their teaching methods are quite good also. They try to teach us in evy possible modernized way to overcome the difficulty of the processes and to grab the matters as easily as possible.

Keshav Gupta,Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology & Management - [ADGITM],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.5,Review from Genuine POV,"The course curriculum is very good, as it has a syllabus that covered all the job exams but teaching is pretty average because the department doesn't have any planned process. About the faculty-student ratio, well there are 60 students per class. Faculty are either highly qualified or properly qualified to teach (Secret: some of them graduate from here and then get placed here to teach).  Exams are held very late and results released are even later thus giving problems to final year students for off-campus placements, for passing exams you need to get through with previous year papers (at least 3-4)(Either you will pass or you will top the exam depending on luck and writing skills).
Try answering in points as long as possible with a diagram if possible. Exams aren't much difficult to pass get Akash from anywhere or previous year's papers from the library. You have to study much on your own and not rely on faculties."

About the faculty-student ratio, well there are 60 students per class. Faculty are either highly qualified or properly qualified to teach (Secret: some of them graduate from here and then get placed here to teach).  Exams are held very late and results released are even later thus giving problems to final year students for off-campus placements, for passing exams you need to get through with previous year papers (at least 3-4)(Either you will pass or you will top the exam depending on luck and writing skills).
Try answering in points as long as possible with a diagram if possible. Exams aren't much difficult to pass get Akash from anywhere or previous year's papers from the library. You have to study much on your own and not rely on faculties."

Student (Anonymous),Kalipada Ghosh Tarai Mahavidyalaya,"B.Com, General",6.0,KGTM COLLEGE STUDENT REVIEW,"Students must pay exam fees, a yearly fee, practical fees, and so on.
As the course consists of three years, As it's a government college, the price of fees is lower and affordable for every student. Various programmes and opportunities are available like NCC, sports, etc. with no charges.
Scholarships are provided by the government according to their caste structure.
Because it allows students who are unable to continue their studies due to financial constraints to concentrate on their studies instead. the colleges provide the scholarship forms with the help of the government to the students free of charge.
Many job offers and job orientations take place during college.
I didn't want the job provided on the campus, so I let it pass. But students, according to their likeness, can accept the job opportunities with a stipend."
