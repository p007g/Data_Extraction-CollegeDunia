Student (Anonymous),"Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT Bombay - [SJMSOM]","MBA, General",8.3,SJMSOM-complete insights of the Bschool,"I had work experience in supply chain and wanted to pursue my career in the operations domain. SJMSOM is known best for its operations. For operations, they have highly experienced faculty. For other subjects as well faculty are highly qualified with master's, and Ph.D. from foreign universities. The student-to-faculty ratio is approximately 10:2, Teaching methodology varies from prof to prof but mostly all faculty follow case-based teaching, putting us into the shoes of managers and making us learn to think like a manager through different cases and examples.
In one semester there are two terms, each term has one midterm and one end sem examination. Apart from this regular presentations and assignments.

We have 6 to 7 subjects for each semester. And each subject has a faculty. If the subject is about programming languages, then we have lab faculties too to guide each subject. More precisely, we have 3:66 faculty: student ratio mostly even though it depends on the subjects they are teaching. Faculty are well qualified to teach that subject, some have done PhDs, and masters in those particular fields that they are teaching. They explain theory topics in the class and explain programming topics in the lab. They make us practice programming languages in the lab.

Student (Anonymous),National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Industrial Engineering & Management",6.2,NIT KKR honest review,"I was getting only this course at my rank 
The student-faculty ratio is about 1:8, you can find so many phD Holders taking tutorials classes formally but they don't even come to class not even for attendance.
All the faculties here are PhD holders and one of the best in their field and most of them have done PhD from REC Kurukshetra (NIT KKR) Itself, especially the old ones. Their teaching method is not so modern but very classy, they just stick to the syllabus and not to the industrial exposure also they didn't give any attention whether you are studying or playing Games in class they just need your attendance otherwise they will detain you.
Term exams are held on a uniform basis every month we can say. As there is a semester of 4-5 months, you have to give 2 Mid-semester exams and One end sem exam and the overall CGPA depends on both of these scores. You can easily pass the exam but for scoring well you have to study really hard coz they didn't give you marks but will pass easily."

There are 220 students(including dual year students too) and there are around 40-50 professors in the Mechanical department of IIT Bombay but usually, in Btech course there would be sections divided of 70 per batch and one professor is allowed to each section for a theory course
Most of the professors are experienced members and have vast knowledge of the subject you could say that almost every prof has completed his Mtech/PhD in a good reputation college like IITs, IISc, ..etc some did their PhD from foreign universities too
If you attend classes regularly and have a healthy discussion with professors/TAs or even with your batchmates about the course would give you a better idea of it and you can easily ace the exams"
