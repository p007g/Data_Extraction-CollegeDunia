Gowtham Chappa,Birla Institute of Technology and Science - [BITS],"BE {Hons.}, Electrical & Electronics Engineering",9.7,Bits hyd,I chose EEE because I am interested in it and would like to explore it further. the faculty to student ratio would be 1:175 and the professors are all well experienced and equipped with the knowledge and are very good.
Anmol Goyal,Birla Institute of Technology and Science - [BITS],"BE {Hons.}, Electrical & Electronics Engineering",7.3,Honest Opinion on BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus,"The course of EEE is considered to be the toughest in general, mainly because it has many fundamental concepts involved at once. The course is a good one as it lets you decide what career you want to get into, be it core or finance or IT. Talking about the faculty, they are very qualified and the ratio is also decent. But the faculty is kind of inhumane at many times where they just want to get over with the course. Many times I have felt that the professors think that students are at their mercy and act accordingly. This being said, it happens only sometimes. Much of the faculty is good and dedicated and ready to help the students. The teaching methodology is simple, slides are shown in the classroom and taught. Physical knowledge is little. Especially at the time of COVID, there was no teaching done as per se mostly because BITS follows a zero percent attendance system. Examinations depend on the course instructor and are easy to pass. If studied well, can score well."

Student (Anonymous),SRM University,"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",9.2,SRMAP REVIEW,"In comparison to other colleges, there would be fewer festivals. In general, students studying here would not expect many festivals because it is a pleasant environment in which we may enjoy our lives not only through our studies but also through other activities such as clubs. The library is the best feature of this place that I like since we can obtain a lot of books here that aren't linked to our course and everything related to our course would be available. The classroom was excellent, with excellent infrastructure and a digital environment. The labs resembled the reality of an experiment that could be conducted in the field. The institution has heavily promoted athletics, and we now have a large field with infrastructure."

Aditya,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.3,Thapar university review,"The faculty are knowledgeable but the curriculum of the college is outdated. Some faculty struggle to clear doubts about the latest software and technologies.
I had chosen this course as it is the best option currently in terms of job opportunities and growth.
The faculty ratio is decent there are about 70 faculty members for CS. The Ph.D. students also teach a few subject tutorials.
All the faculty members are Ph.D. holders, most of them have decent teaching methods but few are unable to clear the doubts of the students properly.
There are 2 exams held during the semester one mid sem and the other end sem and they are held 2 months apart. The exam's difficulty level ranges between medium and hard, it depends on the student's understanding of the concepts."

Piyush Kumar,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.8,NIT RAIPUR-A GOOD CHOICE,"The normal cost to study will be around 7-7.5 lac in NIT Raipur, but for those students whose family annual income is between 1 to 5 lac, it will cost you around 4 lac only and for those having below 1 lac per annum, the fee will not be more than 2 lac for all 4 years. (Fees are mentioned including hostel fees).

But if you want more relaxation in fees then you can apply for an education loan in banks. Banks provide scholar loan schemes for students admitted in IITs/NITs/IIITs/IIMs. Then, you don't have to pay any fees and if you have paid any you will get refunded. Since it is a loan so you have to repay it, the benefit is that your parents don't need to pay for it. You get a good placement and repay your loan.

For scholarships, there are many options like the one provided by state governments, NSP Scholarship, FEE Scholarship, Dr. KK Sugandhi Scholarship, and a lot more. After getting admission you will get to know about all scholarships on the college's website."

Shubhika agrawal,Sri Aurobindo College of Dentistry,"BDS,",8.0,The field and college is great if you have keen to learn,I want to go to MBBS but since I didn't get it so I selected bds as an option after I choose and during my education I kind start liking it . the faculty-student ratio is very appropriate there are many almost 4-5faculties for every subject in my college plus the non-teaching staff is also very much like the nurses to help students in doing patients. the faculties are very well qualified plus they have a great experience as well in their subjects as well as a vast amount of practical knowledge. As it is more of a patient and skilled based course so apart from theory there is more influence on the practicals liking treating patients and providing them the right information about their oral hygiene so there is more influence in that which is also needed. The exams are conducted once yearly they are not that difficult to pass if you have studied throughout the year plus attended the lectures. but it's not also only one night before the exams kind types and you have to understand subject.

Throughout the year, different kinds of events, quizzes, functions, and competitions (sports as well as the others) are organized in each of the different subject departments.

Amrita,SOIL Institute of Management,"PGP BL, Business Leadership",7.8,An enriching one year journey,"The institution has a place com team consisting of faculty and student members that bring in companies during the placement season. Placement purely depends on the potential of the student and his past work experience and majorly performance in the interview rounds. The college follows a standard protocol for applying to companies wherein, the student is allowed to attend an interview if his/her profile is shortlisted by the Company for their further rounds. Almost 100% of the batch gets placed every year unless students opt out of the placement cycle or remain unplaced for other disciplinary reasons. The kind of Companies that visit campus range from Banks to Consulting firms to startups and software MNCs. The average placement I believe is 11LPA. The highest placement this year was around 18 LPA from the Marketing cohort. The institution follows a hygiene factor and therefore ensures placement above the 7 LPA threshold."

they teach very less, it is your duty to complete it. Cause if you’re preparing for GATE/ ISRO/ DRDO or even placement, then you need to have a good grasp of the core subjects.
I am not saying that the course is bad, but, what they will do, they will teach you how to write the symbol of integration on paper, the rest you have to learn by yourself.
Here, KIIT played a masterstroke, by allotting all the good professors to the first-year students. Most of the professors who teach the senior students, are either doing research in some field or are engaged in some other activities.
Here the faculties, i.e. the lab assistants, most of them have a very basic knowledge about the subjects.  Never argue with them. Neither with professors. You never know, a single argument might ruin your career."

Both the trades have equal opportunities only if the student has skills.
