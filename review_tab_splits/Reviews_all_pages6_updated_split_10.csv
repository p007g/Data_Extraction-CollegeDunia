The faculties are very good support and well qualified most of the teachers are professors means they had done PHD in their respective fields and recently some of the teachers are featured in the top two per cent scientists in the world. Faculty to student ratio is good such that in our lab class there are three teachers present in the lab of 45 students and at least there are two teachers per subject you can clear your doubts with them whenever you want they provide you with full support. I think passing the exam is a little bit difficult there are two sessional exams and one end sem exam per semester syllabus is a little bit difficult so you have to put in your efforts to pass the exam.

But in our state our government has launched a scheme name is JVD means Jaganna Vidya deevana this scheme applies to those who have economic low or caste reservations they can avail this scheme.

I watched him work with electronic devices since my childhood. It sparked some interest in me too. I never felt connected with any other stream.
Faculty to Student Ratio - I don't exactly know but I guess its somewhat 1:50 which is considered pretty bad but I never felt a lack of attention or guidance from the faculties
Most of the Faculties are Doctorate Holders
And even the Lab assistants are Doctorate Aspirants. All Teacher's Notes are provided on their Official Student Site VTOP.
Teaching methods vary from teacher to teacher but most of the times its good.
There are 3 exams - CAT 1, CAT 2 and FAT.
There is an exam after every 5-6 weeks of classes.
CAT 2 is open book
Other Exams are Close Book
None of the exams are very tough to pass.
But we need to understand that passing is never an issue. Main aim should be getting good grades. Getting S Grade is quite tough."

Abhinav Krishnan E,Jawaharlal College of Engineering and Technology - [JCET] Ottapalam,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.2/10,All about JCET,From the 6th semester onwards the students become eligible for placement. But to participate in the placement programs you have to pass all the examinations conducted by the university. There are so many companies coming to the college for placement like TCS Infosys Adobe Wipro etc. If you are taking computer science and engineering and you have no backpacks then you can easily place them at the college. I don't know correctly about the salary package I think that the average salary package is 5lakh/annum. To get a job after completing this degree you have to learn a skill based on software development. Then you can get a job easily after completing the course. I am studying android development and I want to become an app developer after completing this degree.

1. Can you manage ur time and prioritise your work?
2. You have to do many things on your own without having any environment around you.
On the other hand faculty members are very supportive but again if you want to be on top then you have to hustle on your own. And come forward to achieve opportunities to be on top.
Faculty members are mostly the PhD scholars of IITs, they have a good amount of knowledge of what they are teaching you. But again being a private institution each professor have 2 -3 subjects to teach to a different year of students and yes student-teacher ratio is pretty decent."

Unlike School Life, College Life has a different experience, and a person needs to have this experience in his/her life.

They want you to do progress in the research field and guide you well. The curriculum was revised in 2019. Overall engineering students have studied everything by themselves so, the same thing is here as well. The most epic part is that you'll learn from your seniors more than the faculty members. Its an army college, and everyone here is an army brat, there's a sense of discipline and respect for the senior and in return, we get to learn a lot of things from them like robotics stuff, coding, competitive coding, personality development, physical development, web development, you just name it. The bonding between seniors and juniors is nothing like you can ever see even in IITs and NITs. Apart from that, the institution realizes that the curriculum is not sufficient so there are various value-added courses for everyone, and there are no additional charges for them. We have an IoT workshop, Python programming, etc."

Also, the ratio of faculty and students are good
3) Here the faculty members are well-experienced in their particular fields they provide us best teaching I find their teaching method very helpful and easy to understand.

kshitij dixit,Krishna Institute of Pharmacy and Sciences,"B.Pharma,",9.8/10,Value for money,"College Life is one of the most remarkable and lovable times of an individual's life. Unlike School Life, College Life has a different experience, and a person needs to have this experience in his/her life. College Life exposes us to whole new experiences which we always dream of experiencing after our school life. Lucky are those who get the chance to enjoy their college life, as many people don't get this chance due to their circumstances or financial issues. For every person, College Life has a different meaning. While some people spend their college life partying with friends, others become more cautious about their careers and study hard. Whatever the way, every individual enjoys their college life and always wishes to relive that time once it is over."

Faculty were experienced. Many of them pursued their BTech degree and MTech specializations and also Ph.D. in top colleges of nit and IIT. Student and faculty ratio was nearly the same.

Anupam,Army Institute of Technology - [AIT],"BE, Computer Engineering",10.0/10,Army Institute of Technology,"It is true, most of the faculty members in our college are good and helpful. They want you to do progress in the research field and guide you well. The curriculum was revised in 2019. Overall engineering students have studied everything by themselves so, the same thing is here as well. The most epic part is that you'll learn from your seniors more than the faculty members. Its an army college, and everyone here is an army brat, there's a sense of discipline and respect for the senior and in return, we get to learn a lot of things from them like robotics stuff, coding, competitive coding, personality development, physical development, web development, you just name it. The bonding between seniors and juniors is nothing like you can ever see even in IITs and NITs. Apart from that, the institution realizes that the curriculum is not sufficient so there are various value-added courses for everyone, and there are no additional charges for them. We have an IoT workshop, Python programming, etc."

DINESH BALIVADA,The National Institute of Engineering - [NIE],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.7/10,IT IS BEST,"There are quite a few active clubs in the college but none of them have any funding. They have the freedom to conduct any event.
A few of the interesting clubs can be CreditCircle which is a financial club, GFG which is all about coding and computer science related, and also there are robotics and other mechanical clubs.
The good thing about this college is that the library is really rich in books. Apart from academic books, the library is replenished with all sorts of books including novels and journals.
There is active participation in sports with team selections in every sport possible.
There will be an intercollege sports meet every even semester.
There will be one fest conducted every even semester which to be honest is so bad that no one attends.
There is very little funding for the fests and there will be no enjoyment. A better plan is to enjoy yourself by going on trips.
There is no campus, by the way, there is one boy's hostel, and one girl's hostel admin block which has labs, and classes."
