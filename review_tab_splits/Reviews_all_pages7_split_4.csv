Nadilla,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.1,Veltech genuine review,The cost of the study is different for different departments like we have 1.75 lpa. CSC guys have 2.5lpa some fee hike is provided by the college as we have to pay only 50 per cent of the fees if we can't pay the full fees for a semester and if you have cleared all the subjects in the last sem and you can't pay the fee for this sem the will charge you nill fees for this sem registration
Aman Shashwat,IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],"BS + MS, Physics",8.8,Review of IIT Madras,I love this course for studying further and also this course is the specialty or IIT Madras. Per 70 students there are 2 faculties assigned for assistance. Faculties are highly qualified and experienced and they have good teaching abilities. All the exams are held from time to time without delay and the question paper is quite difficult.
Devanshu,Chandigarh University - [CU],"B.Sc, Biotechnology",7.7,Info about the CU,"Yes, there are a freshers party and farewell and annual function, etc lots of functions are there they are conducted in April and July. There are lots of books present in the library for studies you can take to home for a week, or months by issuing them. There are also extracurricular activities for sports which are performed every year and everyone takes part in them. Yes, there is a club, named students rights."
Archana Das,Index Institute of Dental Sciences - [IIDS],"BDS,",6.8,Dentistry in Index Institute of Dental Sciences,I chose BDS after my NEET UG as I had unqualified for MBBS and so in second counseling I got BDS. There are at least 6 to 7 faculties in each department. The facilities are good and helpful here. They all are well qualified. They all have experience with what they are teaching and the teaching method is good. The thing is to regularly attend class. The exam is conducted very timely here. The paper set can be rated moderate here.
Hardik Amarwani,Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology  - [MANIT],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",7.3,MANIT- BHOPAL: Real Insights of a Dream NIT,"The Structure for my course is about 68k per semester which is obvious to rise in the coming years accordingly. The hostel fee is about 18k per semester and the t-mess fee is 12k per semester. 
Since I was an MP resident, by showing state domicile and family income proof, I was able to avail MMVY scholarship. The requirements to fulfill the Madhya Pradesh Medhavi Vidhyarthi Yojna scheme were 1)A minimum of 80 % is class 12 boards. 2) Family income should be less than 6 LPA. 3) Students must be a resident of Madhya Pradesh.
The MMVY scheme assists me financially by providing a 100% scholarship wave on tuition and hostel fees. 
 Campus job opportunities are as good as any other top NITs. Most of the top MNCs visit the campus and recruit a considerable amount of techies. I must mention that few particular companies only allow the students from tech branches i.e. CSE, ECE, and EE to sit in the first technical round.
The average package of my branch is about 8 LPA considering both tech and core."
Sarvesh solanki,Chameli Devi Group of Institution,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.0,Chameli Devi Review,"I have studied computer science. I have selected this course because I have more interest in the software side and wanted to become a developer that's the reason I choose computer science. The Faculty is highly qualified and know everything from learning to tips for placements. They help us a lot in learning as well as suggesting more courses to brush up the skills. The teaching style is more practical we use to join daily, lab sessions to practice what we have learned in classes. The Exams are timely and semester wise which is quite good and beneficial."
Mahajan Bhandari,Graphic Era Hill University - [GEHU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.8,The reality of graphic era hill University,There is no campus in this college.

Dhruv Arora,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"B.Tech, Computer Engineering",9.0,"Very good placements, nice infrastructure, overcrowded, amazing campus life - This is DTU","The teachers in DTU are well qualified and are very knowledgeable in their field. They helped in each and every aspect of the subject and cleared most of our doubts. The teaching quality is good. Due to the covid phase, the curriculum was taught very fast and was online in the starting, but then it became offline and came on track. The professors are professional and industry experts. This played a major role in the placement season. The course curriculum is rigorous and made by keeping in mind the industry's needs. The difficulty level of the semester is moderate, due to announcements made by the government for making good quality questions. There is 1 mid-semester examination and 1 end-semester examination of all the subjects in the syllabus. Out of 100 marks, the weightage of mid-sem is 25 marks and the weightage of end-sem is 50 marks. The rest 25 marks include practicals, attendance, class participation, etc. The pass percentage is around 80-90%."

Amrit Nayak,Gandhi Institute of Excellent Technocrats - [GIET],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",7.4,"An overall idea about GIET, BBSR.","I did choose this course because I wanted to join the merchant navy and for that, I had two options whether to do B.tech in Marine Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. Unfortunately, I felt short of the criteria required for Marine Engineering so I had the only option to do Mechanical Engineering.
The faculty: student ratio is very good here especially since you find different facilities for different subjects in each semester neither faculty takes a couple or more subjects in a single sem.
All the faculties are good here and their teaching methods are impressive as well.
There are a couple of term exams per sem and it's decent neither difficult nor easy to pass, you need to have very good attendance also to score well in the term exams."

All facilities for this campus this is a very good campus I like it I am a fan of this university. This is a very mind-blowing campus I am very interested in this campus

Term exams are done in the semester system every semester there is 2 internal exam and one end semester is done."
Shahbaj Alam,Jamia Millia Islamia University-[JMI],"Polytechnic, Electrical Engineering",10.0,A great University Jamia Millia Islamia,"The fee structure of JMI is very low because it is a central university. And they also provide a scholarship program for students. 
 The amount you pay for the diploma course is 7170rs for one year in. (7170×3=21510) for the total course. It's very cheap because they are very low in comparison to other universities.  It provides a MOMA scholarship you fill out the application for this scholarship and you can verify it in your faculty office and you can take the advantage of the scholarship. 
You can get a job on campus Selection after final your study. 
Many companies come to the Faculty campus and they take the student's interview and offer the job 
They offer a good job and good salary. You get a job in your own field which means if you are an electrical engineer then you get a job in the electrical field on campus Selection."
Amrutha R,Maharaja Institute of Technology - [MIT],"BE, Information Science & Engineering",8.6,A College surrounded with Beautiful nature,"My entire interest was in computer and luckily got selected in the first round of cet process to mitm in information science and engineering course. The department of ISE is just awesome they are chill people but a few characters are Lil strict but the teaching of the faculty is very good. Most of the lecturers have completed Mtech and a few PhD. Exams were as for semester wise, 3 internals in each sem with the exam. If you do well with the subjects passing is not an issue."
Ariful Islam,Assam Down Town University - [ADTU],"BCA, General",10.0,I like it,"Most College Internships A 4.0 GPA is something to brag about, but even the best students usually aren't entirely ready for the real working world. Classroom knowledge is only part of the equation in forging a successful career, and even the brightest college graduates will likely start their first jobs not understanding what will be required on a daily basis. Fortunately, employers know this and expect to offer training to bring new hires up to speed. This learning curve can be less steep when incoming employees already have some experience under their belt—making internships invaluable during the college years. Read more about finding and taking full advantage of an internship."
Rahul Pal,INMANTEC Institutions,"BCA, General",5.7,Inside Inmantec Review,"Actually, I liked the programming or software-related things since my schooling so I decided to go to the IT field that's why i chose this course for my carrier
The faculty: student ratio is good, not too bad or not too good but it's about 50:1 which means for every 50 students there is 1 teacher available which is quite good not so bad as per the college requirements or conditions.
Qualification of the faculty is as per the requirement they all are PhDs in their respective subject or all of them are properly well qualified from reputation institutes or universities 
And as far as we talk about their teaching methods that are also very good because expected 1 or 2 teachers all of them have the proper knowledge and have a good teaching experience in their fields. So their teaching methods are easily understood by the students
Yes, there is a little delay in their term exam as per my observation and I don't know why it is happening.
No, if you study just more than a little you can pass easily."
Student (Anonymous),Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Electronics and Computer Engineering",9.0,Is spending 25 Lacs in Thapar (TIET) Patiala worth it?,"There are so many fests all over the year going on at TIET.

Simmy Kumari,Meera Bai Institute of Technology,"Polytechnic, Electronics And Communication Engineering",6.3,DSEU Maharani Bagh Campus Review,"Well, Computer science was always my first preference but because I was outside Delhi and general, behind having a good rank I got a Diploma in Ece. Well faculties are less and students are more somehow this ratio leads to class having free periods. The faculty were good and were very intellectual and helpful. Our term exams are semester based so we have exams per semester and include mid sem exams also. Somehow these exams are easy to pass if you have studied even a last night before."

Lakshya garg,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.8,JUST BASIC STUFF ABOUT THAPAR,"I choose Electronics and Communication, the department/faculty are good and very supportive. 
All the professors are Ph.D. and most of them have very good knowledge about their subjects. In case you have an interest in any particular topic, you might go and ask for a project. The teacher will guide you completely and help you pursue your interest.
There are both kinds of teachers who teach really well, and there are teachers who just really don't know how to deliver(but they are full of knowledge too).
Exams -  Midsems, Endsems, Sessional(test) & lab evaluation are the main component to judge you. The weightage depends on the course, some might have all four evaluations and some might have less."
Mansoor ul Hassan,Academy of Aviation and Engineering - [AAE],"AME, Mechanical Stream",5.4,Good for interns,There are no internships in this course but practical labs and exams are held and they teach you every thing about it and are very friendly and every year there is a technical visit to aerodromes and in the final year you should have to work 360 hours in any aircraft this is necessary to get a degree.

Student (Anonymous),Institute of Chemical Technology - [ICT],"B.Tech + M.Tech, Chemical Engineering",8.8,ICT BHUBANESWAR,I selected this course because of the specialty of the course like we will be having 4 months of academic curriculum and next 4 months in the industry internship (with paid & unpaid both) and like this we have both academic knowledge as well as in-plant industry experience. This course gives you a degree of both B.tech and M.tech in Chemical Engineering and the course duration is 5 years. Student: faculty ratio is 10:1. And there is good laboratory exposure. Professors are very helpful and friendly. I love the teaching of our Minor subject Professor (like she teaches at different levels more with practicals and application of concepts). Exam term is sometimes hectic we have continuous assessment tests here for each subject and which had a good reflection on your grades as well.
