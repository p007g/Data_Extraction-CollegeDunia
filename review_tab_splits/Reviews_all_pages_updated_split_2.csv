Same with the making of practical files.
The faculty of MSIT is good.
The student ratio is such that in a Class of 60 students there are 50 boys and 10 Girls.
All the faculty members are qualified and they have proper knowledge of their subject. But teaching method is very much old-fashioned because of less interaction with students while teaching. In a semester of 6 months this is a mid-term exam and end sem exam which is easy to pass."
