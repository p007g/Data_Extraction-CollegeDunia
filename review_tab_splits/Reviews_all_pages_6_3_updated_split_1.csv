MOHAMMED ASHRAF M,Government Engineering College - [GECI],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.4,Feel the Education in mist,"The annual fest was named Advaya and Tech Fest has the same name Techfest. Usually, those are conducted in January month.
Most of the books for our course are available in the library. But, we should take it earlier as the count of books is almost 1/3rd of the student count. Journals are also there.
Classroom amenities are good. The projector and board are there in all classrooms.
The separate assigned teacher is there for physical education. But we will get support for playing only. Others/expenses we have to take care of by ourselves except for a few sports items (bat ball etc.. once a year). Once I had particip[ated in an intercollegiate Yoga competition. At that time we got all financial and physical (training) support from the college/government.

Vivek kumar,"School of Open Learning, University of Delhi - [SOLDU]","B.Com {Hons.},",6.6,Genuine review of my 3 year in this university.,"I choose B.Com Hons because I am from college background and i love doing accounting that's why I choose. 
Faculties are really impressive, all them are good in nature, always ready to help the students no matter what. 
Student faculty ratio is approximate 50:1
All the faculty are doing their Post Graduation, all are highly educated. Their teaching method was also too good. They understand how students learn and how to teach them so the student can't forget easily. There are Digital labs and digital boards also in the classroom. But as I told it is an open college university so classes are not regular or daily. It's only on Sunday. 
There are 2 times examination in a year. Because it's based on CBCS/Semester wise. So in 1 year is equals to 2 semester. So students have to give 2 time exam in 1 year. 
Exams are easy to cracked. If you study all subjects nicely, then there is no rocket science tough papers. It's moderate type of paper which is easy to clear."

Mohit,IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],,8.0,BS DEGREE ( DATA SCIENCE AND APPLICATION) BY IITM,"I was always into programming and stuff since I was not able to get good percentile in jee i didn't get to take addmission in btech cse. When I saw this course and it's curriculum I knew I have to do this.
Since it's an online course so student faculty ratio doesn't matter they can teach few thousand student at a single time through online platform like zoom,etc. Instructors are good, there is a discourse forum for ever subject you can ask your doubts there.
Factual is good. There professor and there intructors have good teaching experience. They take review from student about the lecture and try to improve them. 
Then are two in person quiz and one end term exam and in programming course 1 in person quiz , 2 programming exam and 1 end term exam. If you study well and are able to spend around 20-25 hours a week then you will get good score maybe even S ( highest grade)"

Term exams were of 20 marks and the final exam was of 70 marks and 30 marks practicals 
32 was passing marks out of 70.

Anubhav Batra,Banarsidas Chandiwala Institute of Hotel Management & Catering Technology,"BHMCT,",9.0,Read this before getting admission in this college.,"Students become eligible for campus placements in the final year but students can earn from day 1 by indulging themselves in ODC(outdoor catering) in which the college will let you know about the job and you can go to a particular event and can earn a stipend from 700-1200 per day. Every year the college offers students the to run a food stall inside the college premises which is known as a food fest in which students can work in team and can earn money as well. The average placement package is 6,00,000 p.a. and can go as high as 12,00,000 and of course as you get more experienced you get paid accordingly. The college provides 100% which means every student will sit in the interviews and can get the job accordingly to their expertise. As I am interested in the kitchen department I will find a job in the same department."

Teachers of this college are very good and supportive, also their teaching methods are easy to understand. Some of them have degree of PhD also . We are having 2 semester exams out of which best one will be counted and on the basis of that best one only we will get our internal marks. After both the exams we have to give final end semester exam for which the question paper used to come from PTU( Punjab technical University).
