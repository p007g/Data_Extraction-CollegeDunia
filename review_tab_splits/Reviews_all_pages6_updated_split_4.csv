I talk about the amenities in the classroom so the class board is good and the fan condition is also good.
There are many extra curriculum activities done by the college like it related project named techmanthan and doing the sports events in the month of Oct"

Saikiran Choda,RVR and JC College of Engineering,"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.5/10,RVR and JC college review,"Since I joined this college in 2020, when there was a global pandemic, there have not been any fests for 2 years. But later they started picking up again. So, there are technical fests every year. Other events are conducted based on the occasion. The library is huge, but most of the available books are technical and related to engineering or other studies, you can't find any novels there. The classrooms are pleasant and have a good atmosphere. There are vast playgrounds to play sports. There are many sports to choose from. You can even go to tournaments from this college. There are also other extracurricular activities like you can learn to play musical instruments, etc. There's an option to form social groups or clubs, gather your friends and organize events. But the only con is many students feel like they don't have time for all these, so if you are not interested in any of them, you could find campus life a little boring."

The faculty is good and supportive. Professors are easily approachable and will always help you. The office staff is not much efficient. They are slow in working and never get your work done on time. 
The professors are highly qualified. They will not judge you on the basis of your marks but on the basis of who you are. There are students doing many side-by-courses, and internships, which they understand is not easy to handle with classes. They are always ready to schedule a class at any time just the students need to show interest.

Companies including Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc. have visited here with an average of 6 lakhs per annum offered. The highest package was 31 lakh from Amazon. Almost everyone gets placement here but a very low package. I plan to get an off-campus placement after getting the degree."

Ajeesh,Mithibai College of Arts,"BA, General",8.0/10,Mithibai college review,"I want to take literature for my master's so I had chosen BA. The faculty is very nice, especially the teachers and the extracurricular activities like Kshitij. I would recommend participating in these programs. 
We had like 80 students per class because every day about 15 students remained absent.
Attendance of 75% is compulsory and at the end of every term if you don't have it. You will have to present your case to the principal so I suggest avoiding any such thing."
