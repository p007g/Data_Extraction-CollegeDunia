Muzammil Ahmed,Tezpur University - [TU],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",5.8,My Days with Tezpur University,"The Course curriculum is rather a tedious one and in my opinion, is hectic in a way for the students. During the initial two and a half years of my B. Tech we had to attend classes from morning till evening and it was draining for the students built on the 6th, 7th, and 8th semesters the pressure is relieved a bit. The University provides a good infrastructure for the labs and the classrooms and is very clean. The faculty is also well-educated and well-trained in their respective topics. They are also very open and approachable for the maximum of the time. The student ratio varies in all departments. I would say the male-to-female ratio would be 60:40. The university holds 4 exams: first test, mid-term, second test, and end them. The exam difficulty level was moderate, but the marking criteria depended totally on the professor. Even though maximum teachers were unbiased, there may have been some partiality."

Student (Anonymous),IIT BHU - Indian Institute of Technology,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.5,Sneak peek at IIT BHU,"I have a passionate coder since 9th standard so B.Tech was the obvious choice for me. Another reason was that I always topped in PCM in school without taking any stress so I thought Engineering will be the perfect fit. IIT was my dream since 10th standard because my mother's bestfriends son got admitted in IIT Kanpur

Kundan Kumar,P.U. Swami Sarvanand Giri Regional Centre - [PUSSGRC],"BE, Information Technology",6.2,Decent placements with a great environment to study and socialize.,"I chose this course because I am passionate about technology and computer science and wanted to pursue a career in this field. I see a great future in this course. The student-to-faculty ratio is good, so there is not much crowd on campus, and the students can generally study in a great environment. Most of the faculty members are assistant professors and have decent educational backgrounds. The teaching method is very traditional and straightforward, with nothing fancy. Exam schedules are timely, but sometimes exceptions are made due to certain circumstances. Exams are pretty to pass, with straightforward questions on the paper and nothing confusing.
overall the environment is decent here."

The library is good, and very supportive. the facility in the classroom is good enough. The sports activities were zero from the college side, the student take the self-initiative. the curricular activities are conducted by the college on a timely basis. The football club and the volleyball club is run by the student only at their own expenses."

I chose this course because the modern world has a lot to do with technology, especially artificial intelligence and machine learning. Information technology course is related to this field and you get to learn futuristic things. The faculty is very much qualified and help the students to get on track for their future journey. Faculty members are highly qualified in this field, they have published their own papers on this subject and are working for the betterment of technology. College exams are a little bit more difficult than school exams as we have to apply our knowledge to face real-world problems and get their solutions."

The faculties are high in number.
Enough that out of around 36 batches of the first year. No teacher has to teach their subjects to more than 2 batches.
They are well educated and got high degrees in their respective subject, no one being lower than M.Tech and their teaching is a bit difficult to understand if you don't have prerequisite knowledge of the topic and if not you have to study the topic at least once after they teach it..to fully understand it.
the term exams are timely with them being mid sem exactly in the middle of the semester after half the duration and the end-sem exam at the end of the semester. The difficulty level of passing is pretty high. But if you have studied with effort you can definitely pass."

Literature is about letting your imagination run wild & CES (Centre for English Studies) offers you this, through the unconventional teaching pattern followed here. 
The faculty members despite being among the best scholars throughout India, are still extremely approachable and engage with their students at a level that involves all, leaving no student behind. The faculty-student ratio is just perfect, one to one sessions are encouraged. 
The curriculum itself is very interesting, as compared to the curriculums of other institutions because it is interestingly customized for every fresher batch. This ensures that everything stays in the loop, from the canonical to the contemporary."

 After covid, forget about good internships for now. Yes maybe our batch could get it, but seniors didn't get many internship opportunities on campus. Those who have got, it applied it off-campus. But those students are few in number.

Snehal sinha,Delhi University - [DU],"BA, Political Science",8.5,The college life at off campus colleges. !!,"Choosing political science was more of my passion for going deep into the roots of society by knowing the technical know-hows of the polity as well. And yes this course is also a tool that aids students preparing for civils. So for me opting this was a mixture of both reasons.
The student-faculty ratio if spoken about, approx 250 students in the dept. and there is a team of 10 teachers.
So yeah it is 1:25 approx.
If we talk about the qualifications, all the faculties here without exception are highly qualified. One gets to see a combination of professors, associate professors and assistant professors here. But all of them are well versed in the respective papers.
The teaching method used by most of them is great and excellent, while for the remaining some of them it's up to the mark.
Exams are taken by DU as the authority and the college just has to conduct them. So yes they're quite regular and on time.
About passing them, I would say, the level here is moderate."

Chenge,"Mizoram University, School of Engineering and Technology - [MZU SET]","B.Tech, Civil Engineering",6.8,"Mizoram University, Tanhril","First of all, I chose this course as I'm very much interested in this field and love everything about it. The faculty: student ratio is 30:1. Most of the faculties are Professors, Lecturers, and Doctorates, and others are those who are doing Ph.D. at the University. They teach us the theory in a whiteboard classroom and the practicals separately in the specific practical room where all the equipment or tools are readily available. Regarding the exams, first of all, we conduct internal tests for both theory and practice and then we go to the main exam i.e. the external exam (which to appear you have to pass the internal exam/tests)."

Pranit,HR College of Commerce and Economics,"B.Com, General",4.7,HR college- the second best college of Mumbai?,The annual fest is MYSTIQUE and there is no tech fest. MYSTIQUE is conducted during January. And it was an average fest but it stands no competition against Mithibai KSHITIJ and NM UMANG. The key attraction of HR is its Rotaract Club it's amazing probably the best Rotaract Club in Mumbai. Becoming a member is very difficult fortunately I become a member and feel lucky for its existence it is super fun and one can enjoy a perfect st Xavier life by becoming its member. Classrooms are too bad some fans don't even work. Airconditioners are just art pieces or statues. Overall not recommended for the campus. Well if a person doesn't get selected for the Rotaract club his college life is a bit messed up as he won't meet new people as the college has 0% attendance. Libraries are full of books.

Priyanshu Raj,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.8,NIT Jamshedpur at a glance,"Fees are high to be honest, in a government college, we think to get world-class facilities at low fees but fees are high, but you have no need to worry, SBI gives special loans to nit students with a low rate of interest and some state governments also give loans to poor students.
Fees hike policy is not good for us general middle-class students as we have to struggle to make ends meet and then we also got to have laptops and all which will cost you at least 40-50 thousand if you want to do Photoshop and editing on it but fee remission is there to protect us if your family income is less than 5 lakh rupees, you can avail the fee remission and if you belong to Scheduled castes or Scheduled tribes, you don't have to worry about fees, you are fully remitted of tuition fees. 
I personally belong to the general category and most of the scholarships are either given to the reserved category students or to the girl students so I personally feel bad due to the fee hike policy of the government."
