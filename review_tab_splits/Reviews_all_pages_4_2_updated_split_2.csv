Rahul,Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.0,Life of  2nd semester students in Chandigarh University,"I choose this course because i Want to learn about about the software technology. 
In Chandigarh University teachers are good but not all teachers are good. First there is 75% attendance criteria so you have to attend the class and secondly there is 2 marks reawd for having 90% attendance which I think they should increase to 5 marks atleast.

Arvind,IIT Kanpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITK],"BS, Physics",8.5,IIT Kanpur,The course curriculum is nice and the student-friendly teachers are also quite good also they encourage if you have any doubts. The only thing here is relative grading which makes it good and also bad. Exams are at their pat level and test your knowledge.
Saurabh,Indira Gandhi National Tribal University - [IGNTU],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Zoology",7.5,Bsc. Zoology  in IGNTU,My department does not provide any internship opportunities however students can enrol in various projects which are going on with several other projects providing institutions such as DST or first however various other departments such as vocational and management once provide internship letters and leave for students to pursue internships outside the campus.

Milan,The Northcap University - [NCU],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.8,A glimpse about NCU,"I wanted to be a software Engineer that's why I chose this course. the faculty members are great and have degrees from well-known colleges. they have vast knowledge and experience in their field. there's a good student-to-faculty ratio. 
exam pattern: 1 Minor and 1 major exam in every semester"
ANKIT SINGH BISHT,Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology - [BPIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.0,Bhagwan parshuram institute of technology Review,"I have chosen Computer science engineering courses because this branch is very popular and with the technological advancements the need for computer science Engineers is increasing also the salary of a computer science Engineer is high this is also another reason to opt for this course.
Facility: Student ratio is about 1:60 
Teachers are pretty well qualified, cooperative and have good teaching methods
But some teachers are freshers so they don't have that much experience in teaching which causes issues sometimes.
Exams were held regularly like in a semester two examinations were held mid-semester and end semester, it is not that difficult to pass the examination with a good score but one should study well before appearing in the examination"
Student (Anonymous),Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.7,Not good but not bad. If possible try to go for vit Vellore rather than vit Chennai.,"I choose the CSE course because it's booming right now and I think the future is software and of course good salary everyone chose CSE as their first preference and I just went with the flow.
Above avg faculty and as you know there are always who are bad btw you can choose the faculty you want for every semester based on the previous semester's gpa and attendance. in vit the student ratio is always high as everyone knows.
The teaching methods are ok I think. They won't teach you everything you have to learn by yourself that's what college is. No one tells you this or not you have to take care of yourself.
Here vit term completes very quickly like btw 4 or 5 months a semester will complete and a lot of syllabi will be covered and even if you listen to your classes or not at the end everyone relies on youtube.  
If you work even a little bit like before the exam 1 week you can pass no problem but for the final exams, you have to work hard a little if you have a good cgpa."
Student (Anonymous),Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.2,KIIT: A wonderful place,"Many fests happen throughout the year.

All of them had their degrees from reputed indian and foreign universities. Some of the professor had more than 5000 citations, and were one of the best researcher in their field of study. 
The teaching method varied greatly from faculty to faculty. Most of them were sincere and took daily classes. They even share their hand-written notes and discuss important questions from exam perspective. 
In a semester, we had 2 exams for each subject - Mid-term exams and End-term exams. 
The exams were quite difficult and you need high level of dedication and preparation if you are aiming for 9+ CGPA."

Aaersh Kumar,Punjab Engineering College University of Technology - [PEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.4,"Good placements,","The course I chose was CSE because I like this field and also the placement package is nice. The curriculum, at first might seem unnecessary but as you study more you find that more or less everything in the course is necessary.
There are two groups in each branch, i.e, about 60 students and there are two professors for each group for a particular subject. Also, both the groups are further divided into three sub-groups, i.e, a total of six sub-groups for labs, and a professor is assigned to each sub-group.
All the professors are not too good, not too bad just like the normal stereotypical image of a professor in an engineering college. 
The college conducts mid-term and end-term examinations in a semester. Also, quizzes and lab assignments are also conducted. We have midterms after two and a half months after the start of the semester and end terms after the same amount of time.
Passing exams is easy if you just study occasionally even before the exams, you can pass."

The faculty: student ratio is an essential factor to consider while choosing a course or university. A low faculty: student ratio means that students can receive more personalized attention from the faculty, which can result in a better learning experience. On the other hand, a high faculty: student ratio can lead to less individual attention and more generalized teaching.
All faculty have a master's in qualifications and well experience in the teaching field. 
The term exams should be conducted promptly to ensure that students have enough time to prepare for them. The difficulty level of the exams should be appropriate to ensure that students are challenged but not overwhelmed. The passing criteria should also be reasonable to ensure that students can progress through the course without undue stress."

You will make friends who have the same ambitions as yours, which is good because at times you will need some words of encouragement and a shoulder to cry on. You suddenly have more free time. But time is never on your side when you have assignments. You are just a number that's passing by. Group assignments: there are leeches out there, who will want to be in your group and then do nothing. If you go out with friends and you have a test or exam coming soon, study, because those friends that you went out with are probably pulling all-nighters as the test/exam day comes closer.
The classrooms are very neat and clean Sports and extra curricular activities on my campus are more opportunities.

Faculty are highly educated and have tremendous knowledge of their subjects but don't teach well. There are almost 60-70 students in a class.
