We also have the flexibility to choose minors, specializations, electives, etc, in domains in which we are interested. Almost all the faculty of the department have Ph.Ds. from IITs or some foreign universities.  The teaching method is alright. Some teach from slides, while most of them use to project the tab/iPad screen and write on it(well, class strength demands a projector). For each semester, we have 2 minor tests (1 hour duration) and a major test at the end(2 hours), Quizzes, assignments, and tutorials happen from time to time. As it is relative grading,  the chances of failing a course are very less(sometimes, maybe more, depending on the professor).  Some may feel the academic load is more, but it isn't anything unbearable, just keep yourself up to date in all courses."

Student (Anonymous),Government College of Engineering - [GECA],"BE, Mechanical Engineering",7.5,An Average College.,"According to my score on the CET exam, this is one of the best colleges. I choose this course in this college because I have a deep interest in the mechanical field. According to my knowledge, talking about the faculty-student ratio it is nearly about 1 faculty member for 15 to 20 students. This is the ratio of the mechanical department but I thought other departments also have the same ratio. Talking about the qualifications of the faculties the majority of faculties are Ph.D. holders from tier 2 and tier 3 colleges, but some are from IITs, like IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee, etc. Now, as per my knowledge is concerned, faculties are very good for teaching. They go through syllabi as well as out-of-the-box ideas. I will give 3.8 Stars out of 5 Stars to the faculty. As this college is a fully autonomous college the exams, paper checking, results, and many more academic activities are carried out by faculties. So it is not very difficult to overcome term exams. It is like not so much difficult and not so much easy."

Since you are still in 3rd year, you have a great chance to improve your CG in these 2-3 upcoming semesters.
CS branch is very generous in giving grades in latter semesters, so keep attending classes or reading class notes which will help in improving your CGPA. The first and foremost step is to decide which type of company you want to get placed in. I'm pretty sure you are looking to get placed in core product development companies like Microsoft, Amazon, De Shaw, Informatica, etc.
My answer will be for these companies only, but I'm sure it will help in cracking other less hard tech interviews like that of Samsung, 
Or it's not a fixed salary or marks you got  If you have more than
80percentent overall - Then you can sit in placements of Google, Microsoft and big companies more than 70–75 u can get medium-level companies about 7 lakh package if you have between 60–70u can only get max 3.5 lakh package and you end up up in mass recruiter"

Ishika Aggarwal,NIIT University - [NU],"Integrated MBA, General",7.5,Experience in NIIT University.,"I chose this course because this University is offering four years Integrated MBA course whereas in other universities it takes five years to complete IMBA. Also, the faculty is great and supportive. All of them have great knowledge and teach about real-life problems along with theory. The qualification of the faculty is more than we expected which helps us a lot. Their teaching method is very good as they just don't focus on teaching theory they organize different activities and give us different projects based on real life so as to make the classes interactive and teach children how to deal with the real corporate world. The exams happen thrice in a semester and they are not difficult to pass but they are interesting as it does not have direct questions but consists of case study and problem-solving based on concepts."
