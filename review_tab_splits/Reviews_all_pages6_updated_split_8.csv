But after joining the course I was interested and there is so much to explore in this domain. The faculty-to-student ratio is good and many faculty are having PhDs also some professors got PhDs from well-known universities such as IITs. The teaching of the faculty is good and the exams are conducted every 1 month. We will be having two midterms and final assessment exams for labs and theory and also quizzes and internal exams parallel throughout the semester. The question papers are moderately too hard as there will be a moderator for each course who reviews the question papers. So the difficulty of the paper is moderate to hard and there will be no direct questions asking for the definitions or formula but they are mostly application & scenario-based questions that develop our thinking towards the subject.

There was three types of faculty at the university, permanent faculty, some guest facility, and faculty provided by the government of India under the TEQIP scheme. The teaching method and qualifications of TEQIP faculty are excellent. Qualification of permanent faculty and HOD of each department are high but the teaching method and passion for teaching are average and about the guest faculty, I would say, they are below average. The student's faculty ratio was quite good i.e. 1:70 but in some departments like Chemical engineering and Instrumentation engineering, it is 1:40 or 1:50 due to fewer admissions in the department. There were two midterm exams for every subject and each exam is for 10 marks. To get good grades each semester, mid-term exams are very important."

SIDDIQH,Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.7/10,Review of my college,"The course curriculum is developed in a good manner as students can learn many skills every semester. Faculty members are friendly with students as they will help students at any time. I have selected Computer Science Engineering with a specialization course in Artificial Intelligence which is in collaboration with IBM. As I have chosen the CSE AIML course because my dream is to become Data Scientist. coming to the ratio between the faculty and students in our college is around 1:24. Qualification of the faculty is good as many of the faculty have completed their PhD and also many of them have multiple degrees. In point of me, the way of teaching method is should be changed as they go around only theory but actually students require a practical way of learning. rest of all is good regarding the teaching method of the faculty. Now coming to how often our terms exam will be held is like around 1 and 1/2 months to 2 months. Passing the subject is so easy as 50% is internal and the remaining 50% is external."
Arpit Tyagi,ABES Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8/10,ABES EC Review,I had taken computer science and engineering which is the cs core branch that has courses that help us to understand how computer system and software works. The curriculum is totally based on Aktu curriculum. The faculty Of the college is quite good and have sound knowledge of the concepts and are also very helpful. The faculty-student ratio is 1:20 and faculty try to interact with each student. Most of the Assistant professors had done Mtech and doing Ph.D. in their fields and professors had already done this Ph.D. and had quite good Experience. Colleges take time to time for feedback from the faculty as well as from the facilities.  Exams are on Pre-defined time and the Standard of the internal exams is quite high Gate questions can also be asked in tests.
