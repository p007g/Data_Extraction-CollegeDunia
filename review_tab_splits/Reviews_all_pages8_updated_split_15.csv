The college provides a specific time to the students to submit the fee of the college. The annual fee of the college is 70000 and can be increased as the year grow. One thing that disappointed me is taking the exam fee. After paying the college fee (70000) the students also have to pay the exam fees to the college to seat in the exam, and the fee is around 1600 for one semester. Another Disappointment is scholarship the college also focuses on the expenses there is no proper I formation about the scholarship in the college. Only a few students are able to gain the scholarship in the college who fill the form. And the rest of the students are left blank. There are no jobs from the college side as the college is mainly focused on study. They provide the placement but not the internship and the stipend which was very bad. The college provides the courses on some websites which are paid courses and some are free but they are sponsored, and not good."
