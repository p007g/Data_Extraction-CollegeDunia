Core subject questions are asked from GATE past year questions and coding questions are asked from product based companies interview questions.

Nishtha Revri,Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies - [VIPS],"BA {Hons.}, Economics",9.0,VIPS - Very Interesting Place to Study,"I chose this course as my aim is to become Economics Lecturer and I found the curriculum quite interesting. Micro & Macro Economics and Statistics are of basic level in the 1st year and gradually the level increases in the subsequent years. Maths and Business English is only in the 1st year. 2nd year would bring up Hindi which most of the students hate to study, but I'm superexcited for it as it's been a long time studying that subject. Later, we'll be having Econometrics, History, International Trade & Political Development, etc as our subjects. Due to covid, we'd completed our 1st sem in about 3 months and 2nd sem in 4 months, so completion of syllabus was difficult for both, the teachers and students. But, the teachers had shown great dedication to make us understand the concepts online in such a short period. All the faculty members are highly educated & most are pursuing their PHD in the field of economics. I found exams to be quite easy, but eng. used to be always a lengthy one."

As for the availability of books we have a Book Bank in the college library which provides us all the books that will be required throughout the course and that is given to us for basically free with just some security amount that is refundable.
All the classes are equipped with AC's and clean washrooms are approachable too.

There are a lot of societies that the students can join based on their interests like Coding, Motorsports, Singing or Drama and their seniors are talented and really helpful too!"

But the problem is in this 21 acre area there are other department campuses are also present. Such as nursing, pharmacy, MBA, 11th & 12th and Degree. So the campus feel inadequate for such huge population roughly around 2000 students from all departments. The second thing it is in the outskirts of the city, and the area around it is under developed. Hostel facility is not good, rooms are spacious but facilities like water supply, bed bugs, drug addicts was not very suitable.

Mohit Roy,Krupanidhi Degree College,"B.Com, General",3.4,Please don't join this college just because it has less fees,"I joined KDC because it was affiliated to Bangalore University and the fees was affordable and less in-comparison with other BU affiliated colleges. It could be because it is a less known college, the brand image is not strong. The campus is also okay, it is spread in 21 acres area. But the problem is in this 21 acre area there are other department campuses are also present. Such as nursing, pharmacy, MBA, 11th & 12th and Degree. So the campus feel inadequate for such huge population roughly around 2000 students from all departments. The second thing it is in the outskirts of the city, and the area around it is under developed. Hostel facility is not good, rooms are spacious but facilities like water supply, bed bugs, drug addicts was not very suitable. So one must opt out of hostel and must stay in PG because hostel canteen food was also poor."

The teaching methods follow theoretically as well as practical approaches and seminars also.
For each semester, 2 midterm exams are conducted followed by internal practicals and end sem exams and practicals.
The difficulty level depends on the making of the question paper, but it is not very difficult to pass, a basic understanding of the topic can lead you to obtain good marks."

In CU they take two Mid-semester tests and then final. The MST-1 will be taken after one month of the starting time of the batch, and then it's practical. Then after a gap of 1 month, they will take MST-2 and there is no practical exam for that. And at last finals. Anyone can pass exams easily and there is relative grading."

Tanish H Talapaneni,IIT Dharwad - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITD],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",7.6,"General view over IITDh, (experienced for one year)","Good aspects-1) It is an IIT, so it's an institute of national importance.2) Right now, running with a temporary campus, but soon(by 2022 end) will be shifting to a bigger permanent campus(470 acres). So, the campus will be pretty big and sufficient, with many facilities.3) Location- It is located on the easily accessible Pune-Bengaluru National Highway(NH48). It is 30 KM away from the educational hub of Hubli. It has excellent weather all-around, with some really cool greenery.Bad aspects-1) Being a 3rd gen IIT, it is still finding ground on the industrial map. Placements aren't the best, but hey, which institute has so? when it has just begun functioning.Admission process-1) Make sure to do well in JEE Advanced and clear the cutoff for the respective branches in the Institute. The cutoff is not revealed until the end of the counselling process.2) Once JEE Advanced results are announced and you have qualified, first thing to do is register yourself for the JoSAA Counseling, for which the website will be provided to you. Select the colleges and the branches(available for you from the list) you wish to apply for and decide the preference order for each.3) There are 6-7 rounds of counselling, with 2-3 days for each. Decide at the end of every round about what to do,l. In simple words, either fix your seat or drop the seat and wait for a better choice in the subsequent rounds.4) Once you confirm your seat, provide the necessary documents and confirm your admissionReasons for choosing-1) I'm from Bengaluru, and since the institute is near to Bengaluru(440 KM), I chose this.2) The culture is good, with less population, you will not feel ignored. Apart from native kannada speakers, students come from all over India, and interacting with them helps you learn a lot, especially the different cultures, and a little of other languages as well:)"

Benefitting not just an individual, but the whole world through breakthrough research. The real gems of the whole journey of 3 years are the professors. They are truly qualified, knowledgeable, approachable and motivated in all aspects. All professors have completed their PhD and post doctorates from reputed Institutions in India and abroad. No compromise on teaching. The course curriculum is well set up to clear the basic and applied level of concepts in biotechnology. Though it doesn't make the student's industry ready, because Biotechnology is a vast domain and a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology is not sufficient to have a strong grip on the subject. Going up for M.Sc. would be a wise choice to be industry ready. The semester exams are easy to crack, the difficulty level is low.  Exams are conducted as 2 assessments and 1 end semester exam, with weightage on internals and practicals."

Tarun Kumar,Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology - [NIET],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.4,Overall Collection,I have an interest in programming languages so i have chosen this course. Faculty: student ratio is about 1:55. Faculty members are highly qualified with master's degrees. The teaching method is also nice and the thing i liked the most is the supportive nature of faculty members leaving some exceptions. Exams were held semester-wise. But 3 sessions also took between each semester. It is not so much difficult to pass exams but the thing is that you have to cope up with the teachers.

Not only that there are various other top companies lik L&T, Wipro, Infosys, TCS, etc selecting atleast a dozen students every year from this college.The placement cell head was one of our teaching staff and she works really hard for the students. The college also went autonomous (affiliated wid mumbai university) and it really helped with the grades of students. college gives a lot of opportunities for self development to students the only bad thing i might say that it wasn't strict wid attendance with the autonomous tag it even got reduced to 60% attendance from university's mandatory 75% percentage. The admission process is simple you just have to follow the mumbai university guidelines for getting admission (online process) and if for master degree you have to go to the college, enquire and apply. Offline admission to many bachelor's course is also there, you just need to go and talk with the staff. The reason i chose this college is that it isn't very huge and thus teachers take efforts to help students in every possible way (academic or extra curriculum).The college also takes extra care as to keep the environment inside and outside the college healthy."

It is much easier to get in Tier-1 companies.You have to decide that.i will share scenario,I have a senior, who even placed in TCS in her final year. She used to be topper of our department.At that time getting offer from TCS by campus placement is big to us. She used to guide many of us.After some time we came to know that she denied her offer, started preparing for government exams. Many said she shouldn't have denied that offer, what if she didn't get the govt job, her career would be waste, there are only less vacancies blah blah.But she never considered this, with consistent hardwork combined with smart work and proper plan, she cleared the exam and became a government officer.So never think that your life is over once you didn't get placed. I know many people who didn't even attend attend any campus placement but became successful in life. Many have became entrepreneurs. So placement is not a thing in our life.If you got a offer in placement be happy, if you didn't get, that means also be happy because God has special plans for you( only if workhard_Ù÷ä)"

Faculties were well qualified and experienced, which helped us a lot to understand and connect with them.
Term Exams were around in 4-5 months of gap."
Varsha N,Cambridge Institute of Technology - [CiTech],"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0,One of the best,I choose ECE as I was not much interested in programming. ECE is one of the evergreen branches. There are about 200 staff in each department for 180 students every semester. Most of the faculties have their PhD holders and few are pursuing it. The staffs are well educated and have good knowledge. Term exams are conducted once in 6months and are pretty much okay.
Ritesh,KIIT School of Rural Management - [KSRM],"MBA, Rural Management",8.9,Life at KSRM - In and Out,"The future of our nation lies in Rural India. We can not go on and on converting everything into metro cities and megacities instead we need to focus on how to develop our rural India while maintaining its core characteristics. Since I hail from the village only I am very much into this vision of mine. That's why I chose Rural Management whilst I had the opportunity for a general MBA. Faculty to student ratio was around 1:5. That is quite a healthy ratio I would say. All the Faculties are from premiere Institutes Such as IRMA, XUB, IITs, IIMs etc. having vast experience in Industry as well as teaching. Exams were conducted on time and if you are good with basics then you can get through it."
vaibhav shukla,Chandigarh Group of Colleges - [CGC] Landran,,7.1,The story of CGC,To be honest it was really cheap and the best value for money. I have tried looking for multiple colleges and travelled to distinct places with my friends as well but nothing better could have been found. It was pretty good at the first sight and and the canteen facility was also great.
SARANSH GUPTA,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.2,A GOOD CHOICE FOR PURSUING CAREER,"The course curriculum was divided into eight semesters and 4 years total. First year (2 semesters) were common for all branch students hence studying common subjects. From the 3 rd semester onwards, the subjects were more of the specific branch oriented. From 3rd year onwards, it was completely related to your specific branch. I chose Metallurgical Engineering as that was the best I was getting at that time and my priority was to take admission in a government engineering college only. The Faculty was well experienced and highly qualified. Most of the professors wer Doctorate from IITs and a few M.Techs. from IITs. The teacher to student ration was about 6:1. The term exams used to be held after the end of each sememster and it used to be quite difficult to score well in the semester exams. Since most of the faculty teachers were also having industrial experiences, they could relate to the teachig couses with the practicals well."
Varsha bakshi,The Business School University of Jammu - [TBS],"MBA, General",7.2,MBA in The Business School,"Jammu University is famous for its library, good faculty and affordable food. Campus life here is nice, however, they don't host a fest like other universities. IN TBS you'll have your separate library and computer labs as well, classrooms have all the basic amenities so need not worry about anything. However, there's no WIFI in the department and that's the biggest problem."
Student (Anonymous),Aditya Engineering College - [AEC],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.2,Smart Experience in ADITYA,"I opted ECE branch. Because I am interested in electronics devices and communication systems, and also I referred my native's friends that which branch is good in this college they also preferred me ECE branch to CSE for placements and knowledge regarding core concepts. To be frank, All the faculty members are well educated with master's degrees. In every aspect, they will teach the portion with all practical examples along with labs. The way of delivering lectures is pretty good at all the time. For every 1 1/2 months there are sessional examinations after two sessional examinations there were labs internals and externals. After that, there is a final semester examination. All sessional exams were much easier, Because the teaching Faculty  would create the paper according to our standards. The final exam also given in moderate level, But the concepts are in-depth related, students must have deep knowlege on core concepts."

Student (Anonymous),Sri Aurobindo Institute of Technology - [SAIT],,7.0,My college review,"I chose this course Because my interest in technical field. I chose B.Tech stream computer science course from Sri aurobindo institute of technology, indore. This college has an excellent teaching faculty with highly qualified and well qualified staff. All teachers are full time and the students are given special attention in their studies. Our college affiliated to Rgpv University. Rgpv exam was very difficult to pass with good cgpa. The excellent results in the university examination is due to dedicated, constant effort by staff. 40 students in each class and 1 faculty take a lecture according to their timetable. My learning experience with SAIT was awesome. All internship and training experience was very interesting and knowledgeable. The life at college is a time when you can decide your career. It's a time of dreams and innumerable paths. Sait has an excellent infrastructure and accessibility from various parts of the city. As per my experience with SAIT is the best college for graduation"
