Shubham Singh Parihar,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,LPU land of opportunities.,I choose this course for my passion for computer science. Lpu promises various exposure and opportunities which no other college provides. The student: faculty ratio is about 30: 1 which is very impressive. All faculties are phd holders with 5 to 10 years of prior teaching experience. Term exams were held in every 3 months and the difficulty of exams in moderate.
Al Zaid,Integral University,"B.Tech, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence",6.7,Good for study bad for enjoyment,"I choose this course cause I wanted to be a software Engineer. 
Yeah, the faculty is very vast as well as the number of students in most of the courses. They have only 500 seats for CSE and when it's filled they stop taking admission to BTech CSE.
More than 80 per cent of faculty teachers are PhD or at least masters 
Their teaching methods are the very best. We get classes regularly very few classes are left unattended by the teacher. 
 This is the worst part of this University we get long holidays after semesters and when it times to examinations everything happens in a very less period of time. For examination, assignment, quizzes, viva, practicals and students doesn't get enough time to prepare in mid sem. We don't even get one day gap between examinations and sometimes 2 exams in a day most student loses marks because of this issue. Our examination is also very hard it's very hard to even pass through exams in the teachers don't even help while the examination"

Chakra,Vaagdevi College of Engineering  - [VCOE],"B.Tech, Electrical And Electronics Engineering",8.5,The college that decides your future,"The course curriculum is based on your selected branch I preferred EEE (electrical and electronics engineering) because in the electrical and electronics sector we have a lot of openings and career growth is good, the faculty who teach us have minimum Qualifications of MTech and some of the lectures completed their Ph.D. also, way of teaching is good, I personality felt that their way of teaching is more practical rather than theoretical coming to the college one year the college study divided into two semesters exams will be conducted after every 5 months in between these 5 months, we have mid exams, the easy way to pass the semester exam is to study the class notes and go through the referral books that enough, the exam pattern is moderate if you prepare well you simply score 50 to 70."
Jagriti Malhotra,Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Computer Science",5.2,GGS talk,"The campus life at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce is fine. The crowd here is well polished and all from decent families.

Aman Shrivastava,Lakshmi Narain College of Technology - [LNCT],"BE, Electrical And Electronics Engineering",7.5,Insights of LNCT,"This college provides a very good platform for placements in MP. A number of major and minor companies come for the placement of students. Placements are the first criteria that come to any student's mind who is willing to join the college, so don't worry if you are skilled, capable, mannered, and worthy then no one can take that opportunity from you, just make yourself unique in some or the other way.  The highest package here is 1.12 Cr per annum and the average is around 3-6 lacs per annum."
Ayush Kadu,Lakshmi Narain College of Technology Excellence - [LNCTE],"BE, Data Science",7.0,My college diary,"The number of Annual fests and tech fests is limited.
Books and all other things are available from the library. 
Sports and extra-curricular activities are very less on campus with few tournaments.
There are no social groups or clubs in the college for students."
Mayank Patidar,LNCT Group of Colleges -[LNCT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",6.2,LNCT COLLEGE REVIEW,The fee hike is there every year however we don't know the exact hike in fee. There is a scholarship on the basis of Jee mains and then there is another criterion you have to be from Madhya Pradesh and then another thing is it is based on a first come first serve basis.
Aastha Jaiswal,University of Engineering and Management - [UEM],"B.Tech, Computer Science And Information Technology",3.7,The pros and cons of UEM,"For this university, I would say that there is NO campus life. There is nothing like an annual fest at this university. Also, the fresher's party was such a worst thing there was nothing like a party over there. There was just a small stage and a shade that could hardly cover 20-30 students. All the other students were standing in the sunlight.
There is nothing like refreshments provided in any fest, not even the paid ones. All the other fests are held in the same manner.
The availability of books and journals in the Library is also not good.
Also, the classroom amenities are worse. There are no good fans in the classroom, even in the computer labs, the ac is always off and the teachers don't even bother to switch on the ac in summer too.
There are some extracurricular activities but they are not the ones you would love to take part in. There are some social clubs run by the students on their own."
Aneket Burman,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.2,IIIT Nagpur,"I choose this ECE course because frankly speaking, I had no other option, this was the best I had at that time, and I might study something about CS as well since I have an interest in Coding, The curriculum is updated, is hectic, classes happen 5 days a week, faculty to student ratio is 1:68, All the faculty members are Ph.D. For degree holders, exams happen each month in semesters and after 1 and 2 months in normal semesters, and passing exams is easy just you have to study one week before exams and yes there is a 75% attendance criteria that are strictly followed."
Meenakshi,Institute of Aeronautical Engineering - [IARE],"B.Tech, Information Technology",8.5,My college duniya,Students will be eligible for campus placements from 6th sem and our college is in collaboration with Amazon Microsoft etc well-defined MNCs also and the highest package till now is around 45lakhs and avg is from 6 to 8lpa around 70% are getting placements I want to move on further to do the job after my degree.

It goes on for a month, with almost all activities possible, cultural, academic, and sports. The library is the best place in the university, with over 75000 books, a good place to rest, sit, and study with good wifi connections. Classes have good quality benches, AC and fans, smart boards, and some with projectors too. There is a green club too."
Ayushi,LNCT Group of Colleges -[LNCT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",6.8,LNCT college,"I have chosen CSE because I always think from starting that there are subjects in CSE that can help me in coding too, but that's not right my college student from the civil branch are too taking placements by getting 9+ CGPA and doing the coding.
The faculty and student ratio is 30:70 respectively.
Some faculty have done masters some have done Ph.D., they are really helpful and good. they have the knowledge and they are ready to give it anytime even after college time.
The exams are quite difficult as compared to school exams but once you will give them you will know how to manage the exams even before 1 night of exams."
Soumya,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",4.8,cheerful review,"Life on campus is bad, to say the least. There are two annual fests- abhivayakti(Feb) and tantra fest(Oct)and one sports meet(Jan). There's one library on the campus that has all the books required for the courses but don't expect anything more than that. The classrooms are air conditioned and the academic building's infrastructure in general is good. The sports facilities provided are a joke. There is no properly maintained ground for any sports. So please expect nothing in this regard. There are clubs running in our college but most of them are dormant. There's one college server run by the students."
Yuvraj jeet,Lakshmi Narain College of Technology - [LNCT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.0,Best private college in MP,As nowadays CSE is on the boom and I have an interest in coding that's why I had chosen B.tec CSE.

Praneeth,Vasavi College of Engineering,"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",6.3,Vasavi College of Engineering,"The annual fest ""EUPHORIA"" is held during early summer in the month of March-April after the completion of sem-end exams.
There are hackathons, tech fests, and workshops all around the year.
The college library is the biggest in the state with books of all kinds and an online library also.
One downside of my college is a small playground and less amenities for sports.
The indoor sports room is also small.
There are many clubs like Swayam, Toastmasters, and Music run by students only. Swayam volunteers for activities in college, help entrepreneurs, and held various conferences in college."

The college must improve this with time because these are as important as academics in a student's life especially in his college days.

Faculty: Student ratio is less than 1 obviously as it is a private college so it admits students way beyond the class capacity. I can assure you that each faculty is highly qualified most of them have Ph.D.s in their subjects and what matters most, as most would agree, is their way of teaching and the way they interact with the students. If you're a frontbencher and keep up with the class it would be enough to secure SGPA above 9 each semester as I've observed. So a teacher's teaching is more or less upright but they always to great measures to clear the student's doubts without getting frustrated as I've seen. Exams are conducted in 2 phases mid and end in a gap of 1.5 months more or less from the start of the semester, and I would state it is easy to pass the exams."

There are clubs for short films, singing dancing and many more. All these clubs are run by students for students but under the supervision of at least one teacher.
The sports meeting is another exciting event for every student on the campus including the teachers. Any sports-loving student will surely enjoy it.

My college faculty for this course is really famous for the political science department although the teachers are good and cooperative we can ask questions, and discuss things in classes. Every teacher has a different method of teaching some are really good at it but some just gave lectures and go and a big part of learning comes from concentration if you concentrate may be you can understand better if you really want to.

Some of the faculty members like Dr. Avinash are so good, they have very deep knowledge about their subjects.
I chose this course because I have an interest in electronics. The faculty: student ratio might be somewhere around 1:45. Most of the faculty members have done Ph.D., so they are experienced but the teaching method is not that good because most of the teachers play presentation during a lecture and they just repeat what is written in that presentation rather than explaining. But some faculty members like Dr. Avinash are so good at teaching, he always makes the lecture interesting and has an old fashion of teaching with chalk. The exams were of medium difficulty if you have the basic knowledge you can pass exams. The mid-term exams start after 6 weeks and end the term after 12 weeks."
