Student (Anonymous),"GB Pant Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University, Okhla-III Campus","Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",8.8/10,My truly view for my college.,The life of the campus is nice but not excellent. They do not arrange any annual fest & tech fest and month in which they are conducted. The process of availability of and journals in the library is very nice there are all types of books and many newspapers in many languages. The environment of amenities is very nice. There are no faculties of sport on the campus. But only NCC faculties are available in our college. No social group and clubs which is run by students.
Shivanshu Pandey,Ewing Christian College - [ECC],"B.Sc, General",9.3/10,ECC - The finest college in prayag raj,"As of my, I choose Bsc, BZC course in ECC, because I love studying about plants animal and the analytical chemistry after graduation I will pursue a masters degree in my sub.
Student in each course is approx 150 - 200 which is decent enough for a good college.
The teaching staff is the best, all the teachers are the best in their field. All of them are PhD in their field and have experience of approx 10 - 20 years.
ECC is well known for Extra Coaching Classes. 
When it comes to exams students must work hard in order to gain good marks, ECC is very strict in giving marks.
Thus it is quite difficult to pass if student neglects their studies."
Uttam Kumar,Lakshmi Narain College of Technology - [LNCT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",5.4/10,LNCT Bhopal honest review by the same college' student.,"Social life is just a myth in LNCT.
All the teachers regularly warn you for one thing i.e. attendance.
I have heard some club names but never saw their groups or their performance or anything. I have just heard that they exists but don't know where so can't really say about that.
Infrastructure is ok-ok not so good and not so bad.
The library is like a school waali library,  books hai pr organised nhi,  you will go to the library for issuing a particular book. but it will take a lot of time to find that and if you somehow find that there is a lot of this and that in issuing a book but you can try, lastly you will get that book."
Tirth soni,Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda - [MSU],"B.Com, General",8.5/10,About internships,"Many more fests are arranged in the annual festival and many celebrities come and availability of books is so easy and not any type of restrictions about uniform or anything they motivate students for self standing not dependent on anyone and Ms Hansa Mehta Library is so big it has total 2,50,000 of books and you can issue books at only 3 rupees 
Sports is a serious issue for the University 
They took it so seriously for every game has its particular grounds it's cricket pitch is so good and they arrange Annual tournament between University and I'd someone performers better in the sports they gave him/her a unique I'd that helps him in his future in exams and in results it's having personal swimming pool which acquires very minimal fees current fees are 800 for 10 months and gymnasium fees is 1000 rupees annually which is available for hostels Students only and it's having the biggest auditorium in Vadodara."
Bhagyashree Suryakant Karnavat,Pune Institute of Computer Technology- [PICT],"BE, Information Technology",9.5/10,Journey to the PICT,"I applied for IT engineering in PICT as this college is one of the topmost colleges. Teachers here are highly educated and try to let their students be capable enough that it gets very easy for them to get placement. As it is an engineering stream number of girls are less but it's okay because the crowd here is too good and there is insecurity at all. 
Then talking about exam, even though this college comes under University, PICT arrange exam for students of same type before University exam so that students get brief idea. The way they arrange exams is a bit difficult but it helps students a lot during their University exams."

A life science related degree was necessary and since I like zoology, I choose this course. The faculty number is different in each department and in my department, there were 9 teachers at the time of my education and the total strength of our department was nearly 120 including UG and PG students. Almost every faculty have a PhD and their teaching method was good. The exams are completed timely but still, during the covid period, the management did show unnecessary haste in conducting exams which was a major setback on their part since the class was started late due to covid and our overall curriculum was tightly packed with seminars, projects, reports and exams. The teachers were forced to complete lessons in haste for completing our exams by march. Since most of the students are already good at studies, they were able to cope up but it did affect their overall performance. It's actually a fault from management, not teachers."

So I would like to share my opinion s on the civil engineering faculty and their qualification. Two semesters per year are there. In every semester we have a sufficient curriculum and syllabus. Before I choose this course, I searched many points about branches finally I go with civil engineering. In this course, the total number of students is 468 and the faculty number is 9 . So, the ratio is 9:468.most of the faculty are done m tech. And their teaching method was good. We have three mid exams and one end semester exam. In these exams, the exam paper depends on the respective faculty or preparation of students."
Student (Anonymous),University of Petroleum and Energy Studies - [UPES],,8.7/10,Review from the student who is currently studying here.,"The course curriculum is quite up to date and it is very vast as well as related to the industry. Though I am specializing in AIML still they teach us a little about every domain related to computer science so that we have known about everything resulting in the higher package. As companies nowadays don't prefer people who are specific to only one domain they want people who can be beneficial for their organization in multiple ways. The faculty I have come across with have a wide knowledge on the subject they are teaching almost every faculty has written at least one research paper. With the help of these faculties, many students have written their own research papers while being in their 2nd or 3rd year. Their teaching method is quite sophisticated yes you may come across overall the teaching faculty is quite knowledgeable here. Exams have never been delayed and yes you have to study to pass the exam. The exam level is moderate."
Bittu kumar,Gulzar Group of Institutes - [GGI],"B.Com, General",9.6/10,Gulzaar group is best institute,"The fee wasn't hiked at all over the course of the three years that I've been here. The cost to study was 159000 rs per annum for normal BTech but for specialised courses, be ready to shell out 10k more. No such concept as On-campus job with a stipend.

Nandini shah,PCTE Group of Institutes,"B.Pharma,",7.0/10,Internship opportunities are good,"I have opted for this course because I have an interest in medicines that how they work in our body and what is the mechanism behind it as well as how they are manufactured so due to this reason I chose to do this course faculty members are good but some of them are very strict student ratio is about 3000-4000. Qualification of a faculty member is Master in pharmacy, some of them have done Ph.D. as well. The teaching method is good they provide full knowledge about the thing they teach but the problem is that they use slide during classes which make sometimes difficult for the student to understand the thing they are teaching because the slide contains only a few lines instead of slide book should be used so that student can know about where the topic is.  In a sem, three Mid-sem examinations will be conducted out of three students have to give any two because best if any two is going to be added internals. It's so difficult to pass the exam because alot of things have to do in time."

There are a lot of students, and the place is always crowded. The faculty are very skilled and motivating members. They are always asking the students to try doing new things and take part in all the events and functions that take place on campus. Their teaching method is very good since they provide notes and explain the concepts really well. I wrote my end sem exam for the first time offline and I think the questions seem easy but they are tricky. It's really hard to get a 95+."
