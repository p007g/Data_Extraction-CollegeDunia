Although we engineers don't need that type of class study, we just study 2-4 nights before the exams and also we score well. Well yeah, it's possible because of the quality of education, faculties are providing us in the class. We just have to see once the terms and the score are in our hands. Per semester is of 14 weeks, and after 7 weeks you have to give the mid-term, which is tbh not that tough. If u are just regular in the class and just revise the course once before the exam, it'll be much easier to score well. And after another 7 weeks, there will be the end term, the final exam, which is a bit tough than the midterm exam."

Yash Garg,Maharishi Arvind Institute of Science & Management - [MAISM],"BCA, General",4.5,"Small Campus, Limited Opportunities: A Review of MAISM","Well, to be honest, I have to say that my college doesn't offer many placement opportunities. The package they offer is around 4 lakhs which is not much, and only a limited number of companies come to the campus for recruitment. Most of the batch graduates are without any placement offers.
Students who wish to pursue a job have to find opportunities or internships on their own. Sometimes faculties also help students to get a job. As per my observation, most of the students opt for higher education after graduation.
However, I do believe that the absence of campus placements doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of education or employability of the students. It's just that students have to rely on their efforts to secure job opportunities."

Choosing this course increases my options for a career in bachelor of commerce as well as in law with integrated options as well.
Faculty: Student ratio in UILS is nominal with ample Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors. With 180 seats per course divided among 3 sections each, available professors are enough for the same. 
Faculty's qualification is Phd for professors with amazing work profiles as can be seen in their CVs provided on University's website. 
The teaching method is subjective with every subject. Like subjects of law are taught in a pretty well way accompanied by ample competitions like a moot court, ADRs, Judgement Writing, quizzes etc. contrary to theoretical subjects which are boring.
 Mid sems being objective and Final exams being subjective are conducted every semester with a moderate level of difficulty requiring a lot of content to score well."

In NSUT you get a good student ratio in our class it is 1:5 boys to girl ratio. But don't worry in the whole college it is quite good around 1:3 (because of BBA). The qualification of teachers is really great, all of them are either pursuing PhD or they've qualified, but it's about the way of teaching, only 2 out of 6 professors are good rest just come as time pass.

Bindusmita Das,Indian Institute of Science Education and Research - [IISER],"BS + MS,",6.4,"Courses and instructors are good, but don't expect a rocking campus life here.","For each new batch, there is a fee hike of 10% from the previous batch, which is fine as per national standards. But when we see it in numbers, It feels very high. When this continues, people will feel extreme difficulties affording the fees in the next 10 years. Being Lower middle class financially, It's difficult for us too.
There are scholarships and fee waivers but most people won't be able to avail of them. The tuition fee waiver is only for those belongings to SC/ST. KVPY provides a monthly stipend for its scholars which is around 5-7000 per month but I don't think there are any KVPY scholars in my class. There is another scholarship scheme by DST called INSPIRE that provides 5000 per month to very few students. The cutoff for INSPIRE goes around 96-97% for the CBSE board and similar for other boards. Also, you won't be eligible for INSPIRE if you are a dropper. Of the 200 students in my class, there are around 10-11 INSPIRE scholars. 
There is no Fee waiver for economically weak people."

The faculty teaching us here are the ones who have done their mtech, pg, Ph.D. with a decent percentage.
They teach very well. The classroom atmosphere is very interactive too.
Basically for a semester, there will be one mid-semester exam held within one and half months followed by mid sem break of one week. Then within one and a half months, there will be an end-semester exam.
Difficulty to pass depends on the course and the strictness of the course coordinator.

The faculty-student ratio is accurate but I have seen that some of the professors are brilliant in their respective domains and they focus on the practical knowledge of students more but there are a few teachers as well who do not always listen to students. The same goes if we consider the teaching methods.
