Student (Anonymous),Birsa Institute of Technology - [BIT] Sindri,"B.Tech, Production Engineering",8.0,,"Eminent companies like TATA Steel offer internship opportunities to 3rd year students, however the eligibility is limited to Mechanical, Electrical and Metallurgical departments. The process consists of a written exam, followed by GD and a personal interview. Many other companies also visit the campus for hiring interns and the processes are almost similar. Role offered is that of a summer intern in most cases and the stipend varies from company to company."
Student (Anonymous),Patna Medical College - [PMC],"MBBS,",8.8,Excellent college with full of opportunities and satisfactions,"Getting admission in MBBS course in government medical college in India is quite difficult because you have to crack a very high competitive entrance exam that is National eligibility cum entrance test (NEET) so after getting admission in a government college you don't have to pay a huge amount. 
In my college, it is around 45000 for the whole MBBS course and fee hikes are not frequent and when it hike then we have given proper notice and it never hike in mid of the course. 
As the fee is quite affordable for every section of students so there is no need for scholarships but yes, if you want it, then you have to apply with a proper application to principal and if they found that you really need it you can get some scholarships from college and after passing out MBBS you have opportunity to do a mandatory Internship job in hospitals allotted by your college and you will get an amount of around 30000 per month as stipend but yeah there is no source of income before passing your final year exam."
Ramesh kumar,Bhagalpur College of Engineering - [BCE],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",6.3,College life,Because the cost was low since my family is poor. Good thing was that it was a government college so the fees was minimal and bad thing was that during first year the quality of education was worst as there were only a few permanent teachers so we had to study with guest lectures. The admission process was very complicated first we were called to patna for counseling there we had to choose our college on basis of our rank in entrance exams then we were told to go to our college for further process so on the day of admission we went to our college with a demand draft of admission fee form there it went smoothly. I preferred this college over others because it was cheap and it was the best college that our bihar government had to offer.
shubhen shekhar behera,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",10.0,,I was having a lot of interest in this course.

There are different libraries for different courses and one central library for the students of every department and an e-library facility is also available. Classrooms are well furnished and laboratories are also average. The best part of the university is its sports and extracurricular activities. There are almost all sports facilities are available and for Cultural activities also they support a lot but only if you are too good.
There are many groups and clubs run by students like there is one technical today club created by some of our super seniors and they used to organize various activities in that clubs. There are some social pages and groups on social media created by some seniors which help you to get the assistance and guidance you needed."

They try to make students work hard to understand their subject. The teacher-student ratio is 12:1.Submission of projects is a must for every semester, and faculty members help students with their projects. In addition, the university conducts semester exams on time.But, the marking system of the university is without relative grading, unlike other technical institutions, making scoring a bit tough."

Vedant Naik,Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.6,Chandigarh University Review,"The fee structure for CSE is 640000. And some other security charges are added along with it in every semester. Scholarship oppurtunities are easily available as you just have to enroll for the CUCET exam of the college which is a proctored exam and the questions are based on you 11th and 12th. The more you score the higher scholarship you get, you might not even have to pay a penny if you score good enough marks. The college also provides scholarships based on JEE exam and your 12th board percentage. The college also sets up any kind of financial assistance that you need. They also provide a loan which has an approval rate of 90%. Talking about internships and placements, you get many oppurtunites in the college, but in the end you have to make it count and use the oppurtunities wisely. And for the record companies like Amazon, IBM, Microsoft etc come to the college but as I said earlier, It depends on you where you get yourself to and how you make it count."

Talking about the faculty of my college, is satisfying. I'll not say it is up to the mark and we don't face any problems. Sometimes we do, but then the faculty is not very irresponsible and quite satisfactory.  
The faculty is undoubtedly well-qualified and the teaching method is not the same for all teachers. It depends from teacher to teacher. Some teachers just read and explain which I find boring. Whereas some teachers take studies in a practical way, some present videos to make us understand, some keep the class more prone to the discussion, these are some teaching methods I love. 
If you study hard, nothing is difficult. I studied for my OBE (in online mode) and it went quite well."

The student faculty ratio somewhat looks like 1 student teaching 30 students which sounds pretty normal. Moreover, in some theory classes, it is more like 1 teacher teacher, 93 students, in one go. The faculties here are either teaching and simultaneously pursuing their higher education of Masters and Post Graduations or some are at a higher post already. Talking about the teaching method, it is eco-friendly and interactive. We have ppt's, open mice sessions, and interactive hand gestures. As we use Blackboard the student interaction becomes quite easy for us in an online manner. In the end, talking about the term semesters - it isn't quite difficult to pass exams because if you know the basics you can easily pass the exams.

They are pretty knowledgeable too, but I can't deny there is a poor work culture in IGDTUW. It being a govt. college, many of the teachers are reluctant to work, you need to scrape their knowledge out of them. On the other hand there are teachers who are highly devoted too and opens up a child's to endless possibilities. IGDTUW has 1 Minor (Mid-Sem exam) and 1Major (End-Sem) exam. It is difficult to score full marks, but if you work hard you can easily get a CGPA>8 (which is the eligibility criterion for some Companies at the time of placement).Many teachers do strict internal marking, but some of the are lenient too."

The syllabus in each subject has 6 lessons. so exam pattern is divided in such a way that one question from each unit is given in case of sem exams and that too with choice and the difficulty level was easy. Questions are completely from the syllabus we get and are completely given from concepts explained during classes.
