ADARSH KUMAR,Shoolini University,"B.Pharma,",8.6/10,Shoolini University Review,Most of the faculty members for the B Pharmacy course are either Masters or PhDs. They're also really good at teaching especially the senior professors. The assignment professors however have a slightly different approach which I don't think is any less worth it. All the teachers are really friendly and charming. The best part about this course is the faculty no doubt. Pharmacy has the best teachers in this university. We've 2 mid-term exams and then end term examination. The first mid-term is about 2 months from the start of the semester. After this only one month later we have the second mid-term. And about 1 or 1.5 months later we have our end terms. They are not too difficult if you want to just pass but to get really good marks we've to work pretty hard even for the mid-term.

So teachers told us that either we have to study hard to get direct placements or we have to do BTech after my diploma and luckily I am about to do BTech after my diploma.
There are no social groups or clubs or websites for students but there is a website made by our seniors of our college.  So no doubt we have a bright future ahead and we have to hustle hard.
We just have a WhatsApp group of our college on the name of a social group."

Overall the branch is excellent I got to learn a lot throughout the year. I won't say the courses are a piece of cake, if you want to get a good CPI you will have to study I mean it won't be enough to clear the exams with just a night of study.
The faculties are great just they force you to maintain 75 percent attendance. Other than that all professors are great and very cooperative."

Kousik Kayal,University of Calcutta,"B.Tech, Polymer Science and Technology",8.0/10,Honest Review of Polymer Science and Technology Department in Calcutta University,"I have much interest in chemistry so l choose admission in Polymer Science and Technology dept.
In our department, the strength of students is 30 and the ratio B.Sc B.Tech: HS B.Tech is 15:15

Swaraj Mandal,K.C. Das Commerce College,"B.Com, General",4.3/10,Life in KC Das by a student of its own,"Started BCom Honours as I was interested in the financial aspects of a company and the economy overall.
The faculty-student ratio needs to be improved, it's very less as of now. As a rough estimate, it is 1:70.
Although the faculty is highly qualified the teaching methods need to be updated. Some of the new teachers have started adopting new and innovative methods but the previously existing professors need to adapt too.
Due to the global pandemic, our entire curriculum was disrupted. This led to the conduction of 3-semester finals within a single year. Although this can't be blamed upon the college as it is controlled by Gauhati University (which affiliates with our college).
Lastly, speaking of the exam difficulty, you can cover the theoretical part in about 1 month for all the subjects."

Jatin Sharma,Mahamaya Polytechnic of Information Technology - [MPIT],"Polytechnic, Computer Engineering",5.8/10,My opinion for my college.,"There was a tech fest held in Hathras in which our college senior students got placements.
There is a shop in the village where  we are living sell books related to our course and some of the students take books from the senior.
In the campus we just play volleyball in recess or after lectures and some of the students play kabaddi. We have a huge place to play any game in the campus but most of the place is covered with the grass which 3 - 4 feet. So we cleaned enough place to play volleyball.

There is a hostel near our college but don't know why it is closed last year we heard that hostel will start from next year but it was a lie. Now we are living in the village near this college.
We (students) have just our college WhatsApp groups. Last year we heard that senior students are making a college website on their own and after making the website they will sell it to the faculty and earn money. And we don't know what happened next."

The future scope of this course is great as well.
The faculty: student ratio is 1:80 in the CSE Department for the UG course.

Nearly all the faculties are passouts from elite colleges such as IIT Madras, IISc Bangalore, IIT Kharagpur, etc., and hold Ph.D. degrees. Hence, they're more than qualified to shine their light of knowledge on us. The teaching methods followed vary from faculty to faculty. Some prefer teaching using presentations while some prefer the old-school method of teaching on board. Either way, they try their level best to deliver us the content we need, and make sure we understand every bit of it.
I haven't given a term exam as of yet, as our classes had begun on 28th November due to the COVID Pandemic. But we do have received a schedule for the exams, and our mid-semester exams are going to start mid-January, and end-semesters in March."

Ashwani Kumar Tiwari,Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology -[CSAUA&T],"MBA, Agribusiness",6.4/10,"MBA Agri business:Fee, Scope and Future Opportunity","I choose the course of agribusiness because like after BSc in agriculture you can go for MSc in agriculture or MBA in agribusiness. I don't want to prepare for Ph.D. in the government sector so there is a better scope of an MBA in the private sector rather than an MSc in agriculture.
Another reason for doing MBA is placement. The placement ratio of MBA students is better than m.sc students and salaries are also good. Another reason is in the private sector and MBA degree holders will get better promotions than average MSc degree holders.
On my campus, there are 46 students in MBA agribusiness and 7 to 80% of them will surely get a minimum package of 350000 and a maximum package of 8 lacs.
The guest faculty of MBA agribusiness is quite good. There are some teachers who are not as good as others but there is a 100% guarantee of course completion.

Abdulla,Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - [JNTU],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.7/10,My experience,"From the 4th year 1 semester, the students will be allowed to go participate in placement programs in college. Which help them to experience more about GDs and interview and how they work. It helps them to gain more knowledge about how things work outside the campus. The average package ranges from 4lpa to 6 LPA. Max students prefer higher studies than getting a job in placement so the percentage of placement is less."

The exam level was moderate, not hard"
