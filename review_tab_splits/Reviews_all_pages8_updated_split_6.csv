This is a professional course so there are only 60 seats decided for new admissions.
if you have the skills you can come in.
The department teaching method is so cool because of the smart class or technical computer lab and a highly modified studio for news productions & printing news.
The session nearby started normally from July or August but due to COVID in the past 2 years, there are short timing for 1 session and nearby three or four months sessions for one semester that's why online education takes place and we got online study about our subjects.
Our exams are going in November or December for the odd semester and for the even semesters around April to Mid June.
The examination process is so creative by college staff. A different method is used in my ist semester there were both online & offline (physical) modes, it is called the blended mode of examination.
I'll choose the first online exam and got good marks in my ist semester, I've gotten 88 percent."

Anmol Goyal,Birla Institute of Technology and Science - [BITS],"BE {Hons.}, Electrical & Electronics Engineering",7.3/10,Honest Opinion on BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus,"The course of EEE is considered to be the toughest in general, mainly because it has many fundamental concepts involved at once. The course is a good one as it lets you decide what career you want to get into, be it core or finance or IT. Talking about the faculty, they are very qualified and the ratio is also decent. But the faculty is kind of inhumane at many times where they just want to get over with the course. Many times I have felt that the professors think that students are at their mercy and act accordingly. This being said, it happens only sometimes. Much of the faculty is good and dedicated and ready to help the students. The teaching methodology is simple, slides are shown in the classroom and taught. Physical knowledge is little. Especially at the time of COVID, there was no teaching done as per se mostly because BITS follows a zero percent attendance system. Examinations depend on the course instructor and are easy to pass. If studied well, can score well."

Piyush Kumar,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.8/10,NIT RAIPUR-A GOOD CHOICE,"The normal cost to study will be around 7-7.5 lac in NIT Raipur, but for those students whose family annual income is between 1 to 5 lac, it will cost you around 4 lac only and for those having below 1 lac per annum, the fee will not be more than 2 lac for all 4 years. (Fees are mentioned including hostel fees).

But if you want more relaxation in fees then you can apply for an education loan in banks. Banks provide scholar loan schemes for students admitted in IITs/NITs/IIITs/IIMs. Then, you don't have to pay any fees and if you have paid any you will get refunded. Since it is a loan so you have to repay it, the benefit is that your parents don't need to pay for it. You get a good placement and repay your loan.

For scholarships, there are many options like the one provided by state governments, NSP Scholarship, FEE Scholarship, Dr. KK Sugandhi Scholarship, and a lot more. After getting admission you will get to know about all scholarships on the college's website."

As it is more of a patient and skilled based course so apart from theory there is more influence on the practicals liking treating patients and providing them the right information about their oral hygiene so there is more influence in that which is also needed.

It's not that cool as students think while joining the institute. One will only enjoy it by participating in this.

The faculty of this particular course is good and mostly accepts a teacher or two who doesn't cooperate with students and understand their issues. Otherwise, the faculty of the college is really great overall and the faculty-student ratio is also okay as 2 teachers are assigned for one subject mostly.
