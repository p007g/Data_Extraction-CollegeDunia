This evaluation’s got credits, so pay attention to it."

Narendra,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.8,Overall Experience of HBTU,"The course of Computer science and engineering is in demand and secondly, it has a decent package that one aims for after B.tech. Talking about faculties here, Faculties are well qualified with all teachers having expertise in their subjects and fields. The teachers attempt their best to impart knowledge to students but the teaching methods vary from faculty to faculty. The exams are conducted thrice per semester 2 mid-semester exams and one end-semester exam. The difficulty of the paper could be marked as moderate."

The pattern of exams in college will be 2 midterms containing two assignments and two slip tests for one midterm exam, and from these two midterms the average will be calculated and allot 25 marks internally and the external exam will contain 75 marks."

The faculty here is very supportive, sometimes you may find that teachers are not good enough but we all know that at the end of the day, you have to study by yourself so apart from how teachers teach, the student-teacher behaviour is very good and friendly supportive and understanding, and remember that there is always exception so consider that also, teachers here are qualified mostly done M.tech and many are doctorate, term exams and midterms are not tough to qualify you can pass the exam just before a night, the student-teacher ratio is quite not fair."

Faculty to student ratio is good here, not the best but I will say it's good. In every department, we have plenty of teachers.
The quality of the faculties is good, which I thought before entering this college. Because most of the teachers are from NITs and IITs, one thing you must know is that teachers should not be judged by their qualifications they should be judged by their teachings, like see a bike mechanic is much more perfect than a recently passed-out engineer because the bike mechanic has the experience.
Every month there is an exam and honestly, it's hard to get good marks."
