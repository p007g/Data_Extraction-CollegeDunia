The teachers are good and are ready to help the students at any given time. The exams happen every two months once as In sem and Sem exam take place at each Sem. From the Second year, you would have practical exams for the subjects having practicals. The difficulty is moderate if you have studied what is required from you then it is easy to pass but you need to work hard to score high as it is not that easy to score high."

Personal incident: I pitched my start-up idea to the Principal with help of the HOD of Entrepreneurship Cell for raising seed-level funding, she suggested a few changes which I made within 2 days.
10 months and haven't been able to meet the Principal due to unavailability.

P.S. The HOD of my department has been very transparent and approachable throughout these 2 years. She puts in equal and extra effort for the growth and well-being of each student in the department.

However, All Vice Principals and principals never want to meet students no matter how big an opportunity you try to tap into...Peons and Dadas are asked to sort out students by saying ""Ma’am/Sir busy hain"""

Adhish Prajapati,Mayo Institute of Medical Sciences - [MIMS],"MBBS,",8.4,Mayo institute of medical science.,"As this is a medical College so each and every exam is tough to pass and also the passing marks are 50 per cent so it becomes a bit tough to pass every exam. But if you are a consistently studious student then you can easily pass or be in the good eyes of teachers also. But if you are not the type who studies daily then u have to study for your peak exams almost 7-10 days before exams least that too with full dedication because in MBBS you have some important topics which come regularly every year so you can pass at least but can't top in class.
P.S. who wants to top we just need to pass."

The college doesn't have a proper campus we have one but it is a combined space for 3-4 colleges.

Aryan,PGDAV College (Evening),"BA {Hons.}, Political Science",6.8,Honest Opinion: PGDAV COLLEGE EVE,"There are ample opportunities on campus, infrastructures, societies are working very hard in every field from the environment to personality development. 'Falak' is the annual fest conducted in college, as I was having a previous year full of covid restrictions, we got an online annual event in April, yet it was something to remember. There was a greater footfall in participation and you can perceive the exposure it provides. 
The library is well equipped with books, journals, and four to five eng/Hindi newspapers, if you are an honors student you'll be provided 3 library cards and on that, you can issue 3 books at a time.
College provides ample opportunities in extracurriculars, but a bit low in sports as I observed.
There are many societies that are working and very reputed in DU circle like the environment society of college SRISHTI is highly reputed, SAVI (STUDENTS ASSOCIATION FOR VERBAL INTERACTION) works in the field of personality development by working on communication skills, etc."
