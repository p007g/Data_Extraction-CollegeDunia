The faculty-student ratio was quite low. And as all of you know there are some good and bad faculty in every college so the scene was also the same here. Mostly you have to study on your own. Give more focus for better CGPA, theoretical know-how, and had a face value.
Term exams were conducted on time as per the academic calendar. It is not too difficult for every paper some are easy some are difficult. So give you full attendance in class on what sir is teaching."

Himanshu,Lalit Narayan Mithila University - [LNMU],,5.6,Best university of BIHAR,"I have an interest in mathematics and want to pursue my future career in mathematics so I have chosen this course. 
The faculty-student ratio is approx 1:50 and in some classes like chemistry subsidiary for physics subsidiary it goes to 1:100 because one or more than one branch are merged here( only for subsidiary classes not for honors classes).

The faculty are very well experienced and are highly knowledgeable and once you interact with them you will feel so good that can not be explained in words. All have Ph.D. degree and their teaching style is very good. They will not teach you in just bookish language rather than they will teach you in a more practical way that you will imagine doing the same thing on your own. They always treat you like their own children and are always ready to help you anytime.

There are no term exams rather than it yearly exam that occurs only. If you have revised the notes by the professor and you have prepared for the exam you can easily pass the exam .Hard labour always pay"

The faculty-student ratio is quite decent for every batch of 55-60 students there is 1 professor. Which is quite normal and easy i suppose.
The faculty I can say is the best here as every professor is perfectly qualified in his or her field. English is a must here and also when it comes to doubt solving the faculty performs at its best .
