Tanmay Agnihotri,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.2,Great,"So I got rank 78000. And in this rank mechanical seemed the best choice as I wasn't passionate about coding. After coming to college I came to know that mechanical is best in terms of placement infrastructure faculties. All faculties are Ph.D. from IITs. Labs are not that standard but management is working on improvement. 
There are two mid-semester and one end-semester exam each semester. The semester starts from December after covid till April ( 4 months).1st year exams are easy to pass but from 2nd-year the difficulty increases. Professors also don't give numbers in exams."
SHUBHAM,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Information Technology",7.2,opportunities in NSUT,"Overall course Fees are 8.94 Lakhs for the 2021 batch and every year it increases by some amount for a new batch. To those who can't afford this much fee, there is also a scholarship called CVSPK which is given to some specific students who full fills the required conditions or you can also avail of an education loan from SBI or UNION bank both banks have their branches in NSUT campus because of which it becomes easy for students to get a loan. If you are going to pay your college fee on a loan then must check the loan amount bracket  (up to which you can't give security ) by SBI ( only if you gonna take the loan from SBI ). 
Campus Jobs is good You can check the previous year's placement record."
KALADI ROSHITHA LAKSHMI,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Amritapuri Campus,"B.Tech, Electrical And Computer Engineering",6.4,Amrita Experience,"The main reason behind choosing this course is the interlink between computer science and the electrical department. Faculty is friendly which helps you to get more knowledge and also the classes are interactive which includes both smart classes and practical sessions.
As ours is the 2nd batch of this course in college we were so less in strength compared to other branches. 
Most of the faculties are Ph.D. scholars in the particular field.
There will be 1 mid-term examination and 1 Endsem including a Project which is of 65 internals and 35 Externals 
Pass or Fail depends on the student in my opinion it's not too easy to pass nor too tough to fail."

Aditya Narayan Singh,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",9.8,NSUT in a nutshell,"i chose mechanical as my goal was always to be a civl servant and not a mnc puppy 
mechanical engineering was not my desired branch i wanted ece so badly but being a general candidate in this country is as tough as being a boy in a female parlour but never the less whatever happens its for the good
engineering me ratio bhi badhiya hai inka 1:5 i.e. one girl to 5 boys 
faculty and teachers of this college are highly qualified individuals and they are very polite in every aspect of teaching.
exams are mains mid sems and endsems along with 2 class tests held in every semester and as far as difficulty is concerned it always depends on the examinee and how much he/she had studied for it but as far as as i am concerned exams are mostly based on what the teachers are teaching during the class so if one is attentive in the class during lectures he/she will be good to score decent marks in exams."

The faculty-student ratio is 1:12, ensuring that everyone is able to grasp the concepts taught and clear their doubts. We have highly qualified faculty, with some who are stalwarts in their respective fields. Teaching methods vary according to faculty, but there is a central emphasis on case-based learning, which makes difficult concepts easier to relate to.  There is a lot of academic rigour at XIMB, and while actually failing a course is pretty rare - the academic load can get stressful at times."

Every student must undergo some form of training or do an internship in the Summer break after the 4th semester. The duration has to be at least six weeks.

There is a proper evaluation of the same in the 5th semester.

Talking about faculties here, Faculties are well qualified with all teachers having expertise in their subjects and fields. The teachers attempt their best to impart knowledge to students but the teaching methods vary from faculty to faculty. The exams are conducted thrice per semester 2 mid-semester exams and one end-semester exam. The difficulty of the paper could be marked as moderate."

The pattern of exams in college will be 2 midterms containing two assignments and two slip tests for one midterm exam, and from these two midterms the average will be calculated and allot 25 marks internally and the external exam will contain 75 marks."

The faculty here is very supportive, sometimes you may find that teachers are not good enough but we all know that at the end of the day, you have to study by yourself so apart from how teachers teach, the student-teacher behaviour is very good and friendly supportive and understanding, and remember that there is always exception so consider that also, teachers here are qualified mostly done M.tech and many are doctorate, term exams and midterms are not tough to qualify you can pass the exam just before a night, the student-teacher ratio is quite not fair."
