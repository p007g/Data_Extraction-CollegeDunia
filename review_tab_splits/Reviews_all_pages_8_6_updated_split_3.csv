Kavitash Kumar,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Computer Engineering",8.7/10,A college having good placement opportunities for the deserving students.,"I chose COE over CSE because it is the oldest branch in Thapar. And also the placements are quite good. Average package of COE is around 9-10 LPA. The faculty  to student in my college is approx 1:50. Most of the teachers are so humble so whenever you have any doubt or need some help in career guidance, you can contact any of the teachers for your help. The method of teaching is actually like every other in India. Most of the teachers have done Phd in related fields. But honestly I'm among those students who don't attend classes, so can't say much about that but whatever I know is faculty and their teaching method is quite good. Our college is very serious for Exams, even during Covid time they keep giving us shocks of college ready to open after 2 months only for exams. Even when no other college in India conducted offline exams, Thapar made centers in students' own cities to conduct exams.  For getting good marks in exams you have to start studying 1 or 2 weeks prior to exams."

Apart from this, I got a scholarship after taking LPUNEST which waived by tuition fee to half of the actual fee.
In one class there is 60-70 student but sometimes this ratio is maintained to 40-50. 
Most of the faculty will be young but they really try hard to give quality lectures instead of just completing the topic.
There are two major exams in one semester - mid-term and end term. Midterm occurs every two months and end-term will be taken after every 4-5 months. And both exams are strictly abode to schedule. Some courses are hard to pass but one can easily get notes to pass the exam."

All the teachers regularly warn you for one thing i.e. attendance.
I have heard some club names but never saw their groups or their performance or anything. I have just heard that they exists but don't know where so can't really say about that.
Infrastructure is ok-ok not so good and not so bad.
The library is like a school waali library,  books hai pr organised nhi,  you will go to the library for issuing a particular book. but it will take a lot of time to find that and if you somehow find that there is a lot of this and that in issuing a book but you can try, lastly you will get that book."

Almost every faculty have a PhD and their teaching method was good. The exams are completed timely but still, during the covid period, the management did show unnecessary haste in conducting exams which was a major setback on their part since the class was started late due to covid and our overall curriculum was tightly packed with seminars, projects, reports and exams. The teachers were forced to complete lessons in haste for completing our exams by march. Since most of the students are already good at studies, they were able to cope up but it did affect their overall performance. It's actually a fault from management, not teachers."

Amer Ali,Vijay Rural Engineering College - [VREC],"MBA, General",8.0/10,best MBA college in Nizamabad,MBA is a two years course which has a total of 4 semesters In my college every week cycle tests are taken which are very good for improvement. The faculty is very good and experienced they clear every doubt of students and take extra classes if someone needs. There are two mid examinations taken every semester before main exams so students can know what they have prepared till now. The student faculty ratio is 20:1. The only thing I don't like is they don't take any practical classes. I think the course gives a good insight into business management and helps to get a good job.

Gnanendra Reddy,"Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies, RK Valley Idupulapaya Campus - [RGUKT]","Diploma + B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.0/10,My life in my collage.,"I was studying civil engineering now. So I would like to share my opinion s on the civil engineering faculty and their qualification. Two semesters per year are there. In every semester we have a sufficient curriculum and syllabus. Before I choose this course, I searched many points about branches finally I go with civil engineering. In this course, the total number of students is 468 and the faculty number is 9 . So, the ratio is 9:468.most of the faculty are done m tech. And their teaching method was good. We have three mid exams and one end semester exam. In these exams, the exam paper depends on the respective faculty or preparation of students."
Student (Anonymous),University of Petroleum and Energy Studies - [UPES],,8.7/10,Review from the student who is currently studying here.,"The course curriculum is quite up to date and it is very vast as well as related to the industry. Though I am specializing in AIML still they teach us a little about every domain related to computer science so that we have known about everything resulting in the higher package. As companies nowadays don't prefer people who are specific to only one domain they want people who can be beneficial for their organization in multiple ways. The faculty I have come across with have a wide knowledge on the subject they are teaching almost every faculty has written at least one research paper. With the help of these faculties, many students have written their own research papers while being in their 2nd or 3rd year. Their teaching method is quite sophisticated yes you may come across overall the teaching faculty is quite knowledgeable here. Exams have never been delayed and yes you have to study to pass the exam. The exam level is moderate."
Bittu kumar,Gulzar Group of Institutes - [GGI],"B.Com, General",9.6/10,Gulzaar group is best institute,"The fee wasn't hiked at all over the course of the three years that I've been here. The cost to study was 159000 rs per annum for normal BTech but for specialised courses, be ready to shell out 10k more. No such concept as On-campus job with a stipend. The fest takes place between the summer and the monsoon season. The library has been recently modified and it's actually great with PC availability now. Plenty of books to read. Classrooms are equipped with wifi and there's a projector in every classroom. The sports culture is great."
Khavali Rakesh,Keshav Memorial Institute of Commerce and Sciences - [KMICS],"B.Com, General",8.5/10,Better than ever helpful for the readers.

The lowest package maybe 2 LPA. The top recruiting companies are GMR Constructions, Somaya and Kalappa Consultants, Mind Space Architects etc."
Nandini shah,PCTE Group of Institutes,"B.Pharma,",7.0/10,Internship opportunities are good,"I have opted for this course because I have an interest in medicines that how they work in our body and what is the mechanism behind it as well as how they are manufactured so due to this reason I chose to do this course faculty members are good but some of them are very strict student ratio is about 3000-4000. Qualification of a faculty member is Master in pharmacy, some of them have done Ph.D. as well. The teaching method is good they provide full knowledge about the thing they teach but the problem is that they use slide during classes which make sometimes difficult for the student to understand the thing they are teaching because the slide contains only a few lines instead of slide book should be used so that student can know about where the topic is.  In a sem, three Mid-sem examinations will be conducted out of three students have to give any two because best if any two is going to be added internals. It's so difficult to pass the exam because alot of things have to do in time."
Kumar,Christ University,"BCA, General",7.0/10,Life of a Christit,"I have taken BCA (Bachelors in Computer Application) because I am interested in computers. I had always wanted to code and get involved in animation and graphics. Christ University is very well known for having the no.1 BCA program in India so this was more than enough for me to select christ college. The faculty to student ratio is 2:6. There are a lot of students, and the place is always crowded. The faculty are very skilled and motivating members. They are always asking the students to try doing new things and take part in all the events and functions that take place on campus. Their teaching method is very good since they provide notes and explain the concepts really well. I wrote my end sem exam for the first time offline and I think the questions seem easy but they are tricky. It's really hard to get a 95+."
