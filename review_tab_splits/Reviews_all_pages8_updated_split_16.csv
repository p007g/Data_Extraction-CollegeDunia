There is an issue, which is, the college the hostel and our appointed canteen are all 15-20 mins walking away at least, which eventually becomes inconvenient every time to walk that far every time. Especially during lunchtimes and early breakfast to college times.

1:70 is the faculty-student ratio for a class.
No idea about the qualification but the teaching method is pretty good and well-mannered, they teach topics briefly along with extra questions and practice.

Midterm exams arrived too early in the first semester, so we faced trouble because a bit more syllabus was left to cover
Coming to end-term exams, it's all MCQ types and the 2-minute timer is there for each question.
The level of questions mostly is Moderate."

Sumit kumar,Motilal Nehru College (Evening),"BA {Hons.}, Political Science",7.4/10,Moti lal nehru collage,"Motilal Nehru College (MLNC) is certainly not among the most reputed DU colleges but it is a very decent college. As I pointed out, it is extremely affordable both in terms of fees and food (and food here is the best among all the DU canteens that I have been to and no, I'm not saying it merely out of loyalty to my college), I'm emphasizing on food because food may be a big thing for an outstation student.
The college has literary societies, a drama society, dance societies, a leadership cell (a unique feature not present in most of the colleges), a fashion society, a placement cell, a North Eastern students body, etc, and these organizations are active throughout the year.
MLNC (Morning) features a brilliant library that is the largest within the entire university.

The campus is not clean either. the school lacks basic sports facilities, however, the basketball court is good and therefore the gridiron is large. The placement scenario isn't that good for the science and arithmetic departments. Though good companies show up for recruitment, most of them want Bcom or Economics Hons graduates. Also, the science and arithmetic departments don't show much interest in helping to urge their students placed. However, that's not the case if you join another course. I even have seen teachers greatly encouraging their students to travel ahead and participate. There are several societies present within the college for the additional-curricular activities. So one is often a neighborhood of 1 or more depending upon his or her interest"

The overall faculty and teaching staff is good. However, the faculty is not as same as of Scholl Faculty. Obviously,there should be difference. So, you have to prepare yourself for all examinations. No, Teacher will help you that much. 


The examinations are semester based. So, we have 6 semesters and all are having different majors.

So, the best branch I selected was ECE in NIT ARUNACHAL PRADESH as here I have the opportunity to learn coding, electronics, and communication part and placement is also good after CSE and IT. There is some good faculty. Currently the Teachers: Student ratio is 2:35 approx. There will be each semester of 5 months approx which consists of the quiz, assignment, mid sem exam as well as final semester exam or viva(depends on the teacher). You have to be sincere in the subject before the exam because the question level of the exam conducted is average and tricky."

Skills such as multitasking, communicating, learning to deal with diversity, and dealing with deadlines are different when you are working for someone else, not yourself like you do in college.  Internships are also a great way to network with people in the industry.  My boss and co-workers were great about giving me contacts and referring me to open positions in the industry. I think that an internship is extremely valuable to a student. It is a small taste of the real world. It helped reinforce my knowledge of responsibility, focus, drive, and ambition. I had to be responsible for people’s money, credit card authorization forms, getting to work on time, fulfilling my word, and completing all of the tasks that I was assigned. I learned focus."

Ravi Kumar,Malwa College,"BA, General",8.8/10,"Enjoyable, awesome, interesting","College Infrastructure
As far as the infrastructure is concerned, I would say it's pretty awesome. It's so huge that you could easily get lost. But jokes aside, it's interesting and the scenery from any point is awesome. No doubt.
Academics
Currently, I'm studying BTech ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATION. It's good and interesting. The faculty is good and easygoing. Practicals are pretty interesting. Classes are chill and often enjoyable. They lack in some places, but it is still good.
Placements
As I heard from the seniors, the placement is pretty neat. They get good packages. They are sure that everyone gets placed. But to get that you need a pretty decent GPA. And this branch is versatile in the job world, so it's good.
Value-for-money
Yeah about this, it's pretty expensive. But it's good though. They make up for it. It cost me 2L per year and pays in three installments. But I think they should reduce the number of fees we pay so that it could be easy for us.

In regarding the job campus there is a huge advantage available in the college. 
Because every year many companies come to the college and hire brave student's who can help their company to grow
Like this year TCS, L&T, such companies came to our college. 
They simply take the aptitude examination.

There is a total of 5.5 years long course out of which 4.5 years academic and after that 1 year internship in which you get 18000 per month salary.
Mp shah medical college campus is very big and for medical mbbs it is the oldest institution after bj medical college Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
So here teaching is good but the main thing is you get many things to learn in the hospital because here a very big around 1500 beds available in the hospital.
It is the largest hospital in Saurashtra currently.
For mbbs there is a final exam at the end of the year so a total of 4 final exams are taken. Over it, there is an internal exam and preliminary exam taken every year after that final exam is taken. So you have to pass internal and preliminary exams to appear in final university exams. 
The difficulty level of internal and preliminary exams are slightly high than university exams.
The mp shah medical college comes under Saurashtra University."

Qualifications of teachers may vary because some are Ph.D. holders to B.tech holders but the knowledge was much more.
Teaching method includes they explained any topic in bilingual and deeply for easy understanding by students and same at the time of practical.
There was similar as all engineering courses, 8-semester exams which have a duration of 6 months each including 3 internal exams in every semester and viva for each semester too.

Ramesh,NRI Institute of Technology - [NRIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0/10,NRIIT- Review,"Hands-on job experience.

The best way to learn is by doing. An internship provides the opportunity to not just apply classroom learning to the real world, but gain practical skills as well.

Meaningful connections.

Many jobs are obtained through connections. Internships provide networking opportunities and ways to meet people who can serve as mentors.

An opportunity to “test drive” a career.

Ideally, an internship will provide a taste of a particular job, which can help a student decide if that’s the right career path for them. If not, there’s often still plenty of time to make changes.

Excellent resume boost.

A great internship helps any resume, especially if it provides a student with hands-on experience in their field. It also serves as proof to employers that a graduate is serious about their chosen profession.

Help society.

Many students take internships with non-profits and other charitable organizations that provide beneficial services for a local community or society."

The best way to learn is by doing. An internship provides the opportunity to not just apply classroom learning to the real world, but gain practical skills as well.

Meaningful connections.

Many jobs are obtained through connections. Internships provide networking opportunities and ways to meet people who can serve as mentors.

An opportunity to “test drive” a career.

Ideally, an internship will provide a taste of a particular job, which can help a student decide if that’s the right career path for them. If not, there’s often still plenty of time to make changes.

Excellent resume boost.

A great internship helps any resume, especially if it provides a student with hands-on experience in their field. It also serves as proof to employers that a graduate is serious about their chosen profession.

Help society.

Many students take internships with non-profits and other charitable organizations that provide beneficial services for a local community or society."
