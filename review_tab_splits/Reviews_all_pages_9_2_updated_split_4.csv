SUNIDHI DHARI,Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies - [VIPS],"BA {Hons.}, Economics",7.5,VIPS - Shaping your career,"VIPS enhances your overall personality by giving various platforms. There are many societies in which one can keep themselves occupied such as Aflatoon,antrakshar, gender champion, investment cells, etc these are centralized societies in which all students from various course interact on the other hand economics departments has its own societies such as kalaa, VYOM, Arthvidya, etc, I am personally impressed about the design of the societal structure of VIPS to enroll max. a number of students thus helping each individual to explore oneself. The campus is always maintained and classrooms are the best part with centralized AC, comfortable seats, and smartboards. The library has an ample number of books on each course and the Computer room is also large and resourceful. The ground area is reduced by the construction of the new building which gives students less relaxation space. VIPS also offers a book bank facility.Till now I have not across any kind of fest.The canteen menu does not offer a wide variety."
