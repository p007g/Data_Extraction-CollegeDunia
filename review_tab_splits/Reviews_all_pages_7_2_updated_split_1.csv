Student (Anonymous),Vasantdada Sugar Institute - [VSI],"M.Sc, Wine, Brewing and Alcohol Technology",10.0,Real review with Real experience,"There are approximately five hundred rupees fees for the entrance exam.
In the first year, you need to pay in full which is near 65000 thousand rupees. But if you are also able to fill scholarship form, you can go through it and save your money.
In the second year, the fee is approximately 1 lakh rupees and a scholarship also can be availed.
There is no hidden fee or charges in the whole curriculum.
If you belong to OBC or from other casts, you can go through your scholarship schemes as you have and for open or general students there is also a scholarship available.

College policy for financial conditions is also great you can pay the half fee after a semester or after you got a scholarship.
After completing MSC many students went to beverage manufacturing companies and sugar factories. About the stipend, you can get upto ten thousand for the first starting months. After that, your income will definitely increase."
