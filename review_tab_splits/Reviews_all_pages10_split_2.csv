One CAMPUS DPU ERP portal is there from which we get all notes. 
Now in pandemics, they use ppt. A little bit difficult to understand but the ways they taught us and their efforts for explaining the concept is very appreciable. 
•Student ratio -60:40. 
Maximum girl students are there. 
We have 2 divisions and 5 batches. 
In each batch around 23-25 students and 1 mentor. 
This mentoring system is the best and they pay personal attention to each student.

The student has to enroll and apply in DOST website, that's it and you can get admission, but even without DOST registration the student gets admission but the fee will be slightly higher as the non-dost student won't get scholarship."

Student (Anonymous),Karim City College - [KCC],"BCA, General",3.7,This is detailed review about the college this will help you in taking decision about KCC,"I have chosen BCA DEPARTMENT because there is a huge demand in its field.

Faculty is average there are many colleges with better faculty than this. They are outdated with the technology student have to tell this will be like this but one thing is good there are only 60 students in a batch.
Teachers are highly qualified one teacher has taken 3-4 degrees from other filed and teaches 3 different topics in different semesters. Now you can also understand what will be the condition of teaching.

The faculty is good and helpful . Mostly in 1st and 2nd year the faculty are people who have just graduated from the same College. Few faculty members are from premium colleges and have atleast masters in qualification . But many are of age 20-24 who have just completed their engineering. Since the college is affiliated to RTU the syllabus and also the books are standardized to some extent. Faculty is also specific to the topics that can come in the university exams . Use of standard books and books from popular writers are very rare . Faculty and seniors always recommend to study from RTU books only. Local books of NK publications , genius publication etc are given preference. Term exam schedule was decided by the university and was extremely difficult to pass. Results in RTU come 5-6 months after the exams. Always majority of people have questioned the authenticity of the marking and result."

Student (Anonymous),Bengal College of Engineering and Technology - [BCET],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",3.5,Worst Placement Cell/Cheap Living/CSE Best Branch/ Great Faculty /,"There was one company offering unpaid internships in the 5th semester. In the final year, there were companies like Cognizant, DXC, Hexaware, etc. The Placement Cell just wastes their time. They take literally zero effort. Even many startups like Prepbytes and Pepcoding can get you ten times better placements. 
In the Lockdown period, when we weren't on the campus, attending only a few online classes, studying DSA and making projects on our own, the College was taking fees from us, and couldn't even utilize ten percent of that amount in trying to reach startups to offer at least 6 LPA packages to the students. 
No. They don't try. I can promise you. When a startup can get you a placement, and a full fledged placement cell, whose job is only to get companies, cannot, then you must know that the Placement Cell does absolutely nothing for the good students."

The placements generally are divided into 3 groups and called Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2.
So the concept of Day 0 was to have the good reputed and corr companies or the high package companies. So the cream students get placed in such companies. And I am one of them.
The next start is Day 1 which is for the mass companies, which comes and almost takes 90% of students.
In this time the companies like Accenture, Wipro, Infosys, IBM, Cognizant, L&T, and few others come and take mostly all. These companies hire in 3 digits or even sometimes 4 digits.
And then comes Day 2 for some of the few students left to try them out and it also has some good companies of high paying companies for some students to get multiple offers."

Kulin Kumar,Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology & Management - [ADGITM],,6.3,NIEC Honest Review,"I had already been decided to be a mechanical engineer because of my love for machines and especially for cars/automobiles. During my college days, the student ratio was good and faculty members are still nice, helpful and well educated. But recently, after the merging of the IPU CET & JEE Mains exam, student strength is low in IP colleges.
Teachers of NIEC were and still are very qualified and helpful in nature. They know how to teach a student and never ignore a student who is in some tough situations in his/her life. The teaching methods included academic classes and practical sessions. Students may also join certain societies as per their interests.
A year was divided into two semesters, but subjects never repeated themselves and there were approx 6 to 7 subjects in each semester. Students needed to prepare those subjects for Half-yearly semester exams. Before the semester exams, 2 sessional unit tests were also included. Exams were not much hard but a student must be prepared."

All the faculty member are good and very supportive ,they always available for clear our doubts in online mode through WhatsApp or google meet,they always complete their course at the proper timing. The ratio in my branch is about 14;82.
All the faculties are highly qualified and experienced, but some of the lab faculty are newly joined and i think they have well qualified but have less experience, the teaching method is all over good but some teachers only teach with pdf and sharing notes.
Exams are conducted from time to time there is only one midterm exam and one end sem exam but the quiz is held per the unit syllabus and assignments also have to submit unit-wise. Not very difficult to pass the exam if you have regular in-class and study after the class about 2-3 hours."

The scope of electrical is vast and with increasing pace, in technology, electrical demand will be more. 
FCRIT is one of the few colleges that provide electrical branches with such great faculties and facilities. There are around 20 faculty members in the Electrical branch and 5 non-teaching staff. Each and every faculty is very well qualified and has many years of experience in the teaching field. The faculty of the electrical branch is best in FCRIT among all the branches. The syllabus is completed well on time with proper understanding, several assignments, and frequent revisions. Sometimes it is difficult to manage 3 tests in a week but one has to clear it otherwise appear for a re-test the next week. Notes provided in the class are enough to clear all the exams so the department makes it easy for studying but timely submission of assignments and practicals is a hectic task but it saves a lot of time during the submission period."

Student (Anonymous),Banasthali Vidyapith,"B.Tech, Chemical Engineering",7.2,Overall Banasthali is a good university,"Do all the students of Banasthali University get internships?
I particularly know about Btech, so I will be sticking to the same, as I have no idea about other courses.
So as we talk for B.tech, Four branches go for the Internship, from ‘July-December’ and the rest 3 from ‘January-May’.Talking in particular about branches:-
July-dec - “CSE,EC,CE,BT”
Jan-May-” EE, IT, EI
Now you can apply for an Internship in two ways:-
Selecting the 5 companies from the list of 70–80 companies provided, in which you want to do your internship.
OR
Applying self in your choice of company and informing the same about in your Department.
If you are going to select the first option, trust me banasthali is going to get u in one of the five companies you have applied for, and there is no matter of your marks or the percentage.
And if in case those five companies do not select your resume, or you could not clear the Interviews,banasthali is going to arrange for more companies for you, as getting you interns."

Nagaveni T S,Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering - [DSCE],,6.4,Way to decide the college based on your priorities.,"I have opted for E&C but I got TC which are almost the same except for the final year.
The strength of the class was 60, it was pretty much good compared to other departments where it was around 80-100 per class. Lecturers are highly qualified and friendly.
Department Head is a bit strict when it comes to attendance and students behaviour which is good but sometimes as students, we found it irritating, but thanks to the facilities that we didn't lag in our academics.
HOD has the least in other curriculum activities as I noticed.
The teaching method of more than half of the faculty was good and very few lecturer's teaching was a bit boring.
Our college was affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University so the semester exams were according to the university schedule. Exam terms used to last for 30 to 40 days for each semester along we had 3 monthly internals. The exam's difficulty rate is moderate."

Core companies are less but they are one of the best in their field.The highest package for the core will be around 6-8 LPA. Placement cell takes very less initiative in bringing new companies to the campus placement. But the training provided is good. Also, there will be very tricky rules as to how to limit a good student from getting placed in more than 1 tier one company. There is no choice given to sit for another company if you are already placed with a core company with the average package"

If a student has studied properly accordingly to the professor then the exams are as easy to score but if you haven't revised or studied anything then it's really difficult for one to qualify.

Most of the teachers who taught me hold a doctorate degree in their respective fields and they have an amazing ways of teaching. They not only prepared us for exams but gives a bunch of extra knowledge which is surely gonna help in various competitive exams and sometimes they even take evening classes to complete the syllabus as because of the pandemic our semester was short. But one thing is for sure they are not going to leave when a penny thing in the syllabus. 
The exams were held on the date on which we were earlier informed and the exams were pretty easy and teachers taught even more than that in class. After learning so much and then looking at the question paper seems like its more than easy."
Boobalan,Mohamed Sathak College of Arts and Science,"B.Com, Computer Applications",6.8,Not so good college for securing a job through campus interview,Whoa! I was actually into computers from my school days so I opted for this course which blends both computer usage and some numbers too. The ratio of faculty/students will be around 1:5. The teachers are very knowledgeable and surely you can gain more if you want to. They mostly focus on the syllables but on an interest basis you can gain more practical knowledge.  They will conduct a semester exam under madras university every 6 months

Himanshu Trivedi,GH Raisoni College of Engineering - [GHRCE],,8.0,GHRCE~College with Average Placement and Great Opportunities in Extra Curricular Activities,"I always wanted to be a Software Engineer so I chose the field of I.T . CSE cutoff was also high during the 3 rounds so I settled up with the IT department. Now Let's talk about the faculty: student ratio, so there are 60-80 students in a class. Normally there are 2-3 sections for each department depending upon the no. of students. But, the one who is serious can always find a good mentor and can study and acquire new skills on his/her own. Almost all the faculties have completed their Ph.D. and the rest are pursuing their Ph.D. along with teaching. Teaching methods have their own pros and cons. Since it is Autonomous Institute, the Course is updated as per the industry requirements. Some teachers are excellent and teach real-world skills and some just teach to finish the course curriculum. Overall teaching is good and self-study is more important in the engineering field. CAE and TAE are taken monthly and a final End Semester is there at the end. One can easily manage his time as there is no such pressure of exams."
