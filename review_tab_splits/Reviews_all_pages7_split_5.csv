There are 3-4 faculties for each subject and there is also a program called mentor-mentee in which one can approach a mentor to share or ask something not only related to academics but also about individuals' problems.
Almost every faculty is doing PhD. or already completed his/her Ph.D. .some of them have done from renowned colleges. I can say that the faculty members are well qualified.
There are three stages of the exams before the external exam first is the assessment test which is 30 marks and is easy to pass like if you concentrate in the classes then you can easily get through it. The second test is a sessional test which is also 30 marks but it is moderately difficult. And finally, pue which is of 100 marks."

Kawin,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,"B.Tech, Chemical Engineering",9.2,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham - Where Great Engineers are made.,"A usual 4-year course in chemical engineering.  The curriculum was far more than needed for UG. The course chapters were so well designed which means all the courses were lined up for students in such a way that one course's outcome is the other one's introduction. Unlike other courses, chemical engineering is so in demand. I want to make it clear that most colleges do not have this course. Almost 30 plus subjects are included in the full-time course, so 53 students have a sufficient amount of faculties who guide them well.
Almost all the faculties are Ph.D. scholars from different colleges and universities in the world.
The exams that were conducted by the college were so logical and passing them would be more challenging because the questions are out of books."

So the cost of the study is not much as compared to even school fees that vary from 70000 to 150000.
But the college does not have any hostel facilities so if you don't reside in Delhi, your other cost like if you'll take a room or PG will increase your overall expenses.
A very small portion of students fetch internships and the stipend is not at all impressive ( almost  2k to 3k )."
Shruti Sharma,"Institute of Engineering and Technology, Devi Ahilya University - [IET -DAVV]","BE, Computer Engineering",8.4,IET- DAVV,"The campus life here at IET is probably the best one in Indore.

Clubs here are pretty much active and fun too.
Here at IET, we have central India's biggest cultural fest AAKSHANK. Celebrities like KK, Zakir Hussain, and Jubin Nautiyal had earlier performed here.
You'll get mostly academic books in the library and you don't need to buy them yourself which is a plus point.

M D,Vidyasagar School of Social Works - [VSSW],"MSW,",7.0,Overview of VSSW,"I choose this course because this is a professional and very interesting course it grabbed my attention. I want to do something in this field. The facilities are surprisingly quite good all of the facilities provide as much support as they can give the students. Students are much more than faculties but those who are taught all are highly educated high degree people. Even some of the faculties are still studying for much higher education like doctorate, Ph.D. degree. the exam system is like in one semester you get an internal exam of 20 marks in the mid semester and in last of the semester you'll get 80 marks final exam. And in this course they're important subject fieldwork, in which you have to do an internship in an organization this may contain like an internship it self 80 marks and after the exam, you have to give viva according to fieldwork it contains 20 marks. But if you failed in fieldwork you have to repeat the semester."

also, the fees policies are such that recently there is a fees hike for the students which is about 5000 to 6000 per year so you can see that 20000 for 4-year degree course is recently updated in the course fees.
Talking about the scholarships and financial assistance then there are loads of opportunities for the scholarships and financial situations for a student so it provides the scholarship for the SC and the ST students and it greatly reduces the fees for the AWS category also it can be around 17k to 20k for EWS category students so it will be very helpful scholarship all the awes category student and SC ST category student also there is a policy for the OBC category student."
