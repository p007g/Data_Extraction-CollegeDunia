The fest is organized/month except for exam time and summer vacation but before vacation one summer fest is organized that makes your time memorable, I remember when I was in my finals our juniors organized that food fest in which they'll cook different dishes and sell that in the campus as a part of food exhibition.
Apart from this tech exhibition is celebrated surprisingly but the teacher makes you aware of that previously to prepare yourself.
Students take part in it from different colleges and the winner is awarded different awards and guests.

Gourav Bhati,Sri Venkateswara College - Delhi,"BA {Hons.}, Political Science",7.6/10,SVC from a student's view,"The course curriculum is also very decently managed but it has rigidity in opting for courses from different streams which would by itself get changes with implementation of NEP. 
Also, the education system in itself needs a reform with less importance to rote learning as with ICT revolution in hands of almost everyone, the traditional notion of parameter of judging people's intellect on basis of remembering something which might never help someone is counterproductive. 
According to the requisites of questions I opted for this course because I am a UPSC aspirant and this course in my opinion will help me in this Exam. 
Student teacher ratio in my own class is very poor reaching a staggering 1:127. 
Teachers are well qualified but this doesn't automatically make them well equipped with the delivery of their own knowledge. They still rely on age old techniques of teaching. 
Exams were held timely with a gap of around 4-5 months in between Semester exams. 
Exams were indeed difficult in nature."
