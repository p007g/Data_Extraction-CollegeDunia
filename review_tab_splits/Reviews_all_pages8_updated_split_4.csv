It also has, amazing facilities. The open auditorium of the college is a vibe. College also has amazing facilities in the hostel. The hostel and Campus building are separated and have a subway to travel. MUJ has a very strong infrastructure in the building, labs, clean and well-sanitised washroom and plenty of drinking water dispensers. In terms of class and labs, all rooms are air-conditioned and have plenty of sunlight exposure. The labs are well equipped with well-qualified lab technicians who are very helpful. But what MUJ lacks is the access to the internet. It just provides 30GB of monthly data with poor connectivity. Earlier it was a meagre 15GB/month only. & The gym is top quality along with a sauna."
