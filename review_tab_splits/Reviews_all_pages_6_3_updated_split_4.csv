Practical and theory paper exam are connected separately"

There are around 30 student-run committees and interest groups, which results in there always something happening. The annual fest EV happens every November, where a lot of B-schools come to compete in business & sports competitions. Along with it, there is the prestigious XL vs IIM-C sports meet that has been going on for decades. The infrastructure is really good, with one-sided motion allowed inside the hostels. The campus is full of greenery and a lot of eateries which helps students to have food available 24/7 for the students. The hostels are not Air conditioned, but the discussion rooms, library, mess, and lecture halls are. Overall, the campus life is amazing, especially as the 2023-25 batch will be getting hostels at the old hostel side, which is too beautiful."

Raman Global University,"There are many clubs such as chess, dance, art, cricket, basketball, volleyball,etc. The college never pays attention to football even when there are many good players who are willing to form a football club and go for tournament, they don't even provide a good ground to play football, this is a issue I faced myself. The meal provided by the college mess is just bad, even the plates they serve are covered in oil because its not washed properly.

One good thing is that the college has one of the best cricket ground and really well maintained."

On Diwali also students collected and organized a function. There are very few books in the library even not a single Hindi book but it is good that books are increasing every month in the library. 
There is no outdoor sports ground for the university, only a small coat for volleyball in the boys' hostel, extra curricular activities are done every month more than thrice like painting, dancing, singing, education, and many others.
