The faculty and student ratio is 1 teacher for 120 students. The faculty members were well qualified and well versed in communicating with the students. Some teachers PhD as well. The teaching method was good as there was a regular conversation between the teacher and the students and at each term exam before the internals, there was a presentation that was to be done by the students for marks. Which actually has helped each student to improve on their own presentation skills. There was a whiteboard and projector as well to teach properly. The term exams were on time after a month of the start of 1st term we would have our internals for 20 marks and 5 marks presentation. And after 2 months we would have our final exams for 75 marks. The exams were good for those who studied and bad for those who didn't. The exam paper had questions which they taught in the class and some questions which really made us think."

Student (Anonymous),Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Information Technology",10.0,Life at CU 2021,Some teachers are inexperienced but experienced teachers are also present in each department.

* My college is not very big, and that doesn't even matters. Approx 15 teachers are there in my college. According to my best knowledge, our college's faculty to student ratio would be 1: 40, which is very good according to me, as each student gets good attention from the teacher.
