The library is also good most of the reference books are available there but the only issue is with the due date as books are issued for only 2 weeks and you have to get them reissued after 2 weeks and there's a 5rupees/day fine after the due date. The sports club is also good like kabaddi, cricket, basketball and table tennis. Debating committees are also available."

The faculy student ratio here is quite good. I would say there would be 1:70 ratio and there isn't any issue for teachers. Yes sometimes in first year , there are issues when new teachers join and they cant match up with students properly.
Most of the faculty in my first year. has done phd. Or mtech. From good colleges like NIT or IITS. There are lectures and tutorials to solve problems as well. You will be taught in lectures and you will be given sheets which you can solve and ask doubts in tutorials.

In mid exams, exam papers were prepared by our college faculties only when compared to SEM  exams MID exams were a little bit easy so we can write these exams without any tension whereas coming to SEM exams these papers were prepared by JNTU HYDERABAD so we cant expect in which way the exam paper was coming. Sometimes moderate paper would come and sometimes hard paper would come other than these two we cant expect the easy paper in any JNTU exams. We have to study hard and we have to clear the exam finally. The same was followed to clear the SEM EXAMS as well as the MID exams."

I have a keen interest in microorganisms which are ubiquitous. My college course curriculum is very good and very upgraded, practical based which makes us so helpful to enhance and strengthen our knowledge. 
The faculty is also very good and professional. All the professors are very cooperative and student-friendly. We have 4 professors and 17 students in our classroom. So the faculty-student ratio is in limit. 
Her teaching is very disciplined and routine based. They teach us practical-based teaching which makes us more interested in the subject. They all are post-doctorate from abroad which is very professional.

Tanmay Barik,"Prananath College , Khurda","B.Sc {Hons.}, Geography",2.3,Our college's review,The fees amount is a little big as compared to other colleges. cost to study is a little big and there are many scholarships also given to eligible students but the job we didn't get on campus with stipends. so it's a bad impact on our college. The fee is approx 9000 per annum in our college.
Manisha Saini,BK Birla Institute of Engineering and Technology [BKBIET],"B.Tech, Information Technology",8.2,Best College In Jhunjhunu,The course curriculum is quite impressive and good looking to the local college in this locality.

Prashanthi Jagannathan,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Sc + M.Sc, Biotechnology",7.3,VIT as a fresher,"My reasons for choosing this course we're that it was biology related, did not have maths in 12th as a requirement, and is a five-year course so I can pursue a Ph.D. immediately upon graduation. I was also pretty tired of entrance and competitive exams after 12th so I did not want to go through that again after 3 years if I'd chosen to do a BSc.
The faculty: student ratio is not very desirable as there are over 50 students in each class crammed into tiny classrooms. There are over 160 students in the 2022 batch and only three groups so it does get pretty cramped.
The quality of the faculty I feel is quite average. Some teachers are amazing and always know how to engage the class and keep it interesting, while some only read out slides and leave them at that. There are strict teachers and easy-going ones like every other University and school. 
You'll have an exam almost every month and a half and it's an endless cycle. CAT1, CAT2, and FAT with assignments and quizzes which is pretty frustrating."
Sriman narayanan,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.2,Miracles of VIT,"The fee structure is hideous, if you get below the 5000 ranks there is a high chance you can get the lowest fee of 200000 but if you fail to get so you will have to pay like 300000, 400000, 450000, 500000. Some people say there is still a 6th category i.e 600000 and the 7th i.e 700000. This is just too much rip-off, never get to the college if you get more than 300000."

Yes, IIIT Nagpur has a small library that has all the curriculum-related books along with some novels. All the classrooms are equipped with ACs, a projector, and good furniture.

Jyotiraditya Sikder,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),"BE {Hons.}, Chemical Engineering",9.8,BITS Pilani - Its Magic,The course curriculum is well structured and you are given the freedom to choose any course at any point in time provided you have fulfilled the prerequisites. You are given the freedom to build your own timetable and choose your own professors. 100% of the Professors are experienced and have a well-performed post-doctorate from a reputed university. There is faculty to student ratio of around 1:3 in every branch and you can approach any Professor with your doubts.

There is a 2 floor library and is good place if you want to do you work in peace. But the library timings is less according to me as it closes at 6 pm on weekdays and on weekdays it closes at 4 pm. Classrooms have a strength of 70 on an average. Some classrooms are too luxurious for a classroom but also there are few pretty ok for a classroom. There are quite a few clubs such as gaming club, robotics club, IOS club , android development club, sports club , even an anime club and many more clubs. Many of which are operated by students. The only thing I think to warn you about is that boys hostel is around 2 km far from academic block thus you have to walk quite a lot .But if you go with your friends,to be honest it dosent bother that much. Cycle is allowed also."

Each and every college of DU organizes its fest every year which is best in itself. Usually, it is organized in the months of February and March.
Again, the infrastructure of Du colleges is different from each other. However, no college has bad infrastructure. Those who have old buildings are working for re-innovation.
If I talk about college libraries, then for me there is no book that we cannot get from Library.
Also, sports facilities can be judged by this line: Almost all common genes are there in colleges and there are tournaments or matches which are being organized at college levels, University levels, etc.
There are many social groups of students e.g Unity in my college. However, I never joined anything.?"

Most of the faculty have either completed their Ph.D. or are currently pursuing it within the university, while others have done their MTech and are good at teaching. While you might find some teachers teaching methods to be a bit novice.
The exams are conducted timely like mid sem, ends, and the CAs the exam are of moderate level and the questions are mostly from the study material provided by teachers."

Umansh Agarwal,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.7,What is it like being an SRMite,"The course that I chose was CSE, with a specialization in IoT. I am, to an extent, satisfied with the system and opportunities I received with this course. I want to mention to all the freshers that you must create an opportunity and grab it. You can not rely on others to always help you out. For example, when I heard about the concept of in-house projects in SRM, I was probably the first in my batch to go ahead and start a project with my faculty members. Because of this, I have gained a lot of reputation and received offers from many teachers for research. I am currently doing research under faculty from Saudi Arabia and developing ML models. The teachers over here can thus be concluded as very supportive and well-qualified. The male-to-female ratio over here is way better than the colleges I know about. Exams are also pretty easy to pass and take up a good test of your knowledge. I have also felt that the college's curriculum indirectly trains the students enough for higher studies."

Mamta Khanduri,College of Vocational Studies - [CVS],"B.Voc, Tourism Management",6.8,College of Vocational Studies,Life on a college campus totally depends upon the nature of a person and fests happen from February to April.

Manjul Gupta,IIT Delhi - Indian Institute of Technology [IITD],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",7.8,Internships at IITD,"I had to go for UPSC civil services exam. So this course seemed to be the most appropriate one for it.
Faculty to student ratio was really great. It is not fixed. It rather depends upon the course you are pursuing. Could be anything like 30 to 600 students. Usually, 120-150 students are in a class. There are about 850 faculty members.
Most of the faculty have some higher education from renowned foreign institutes. About 40% teach really nicely. 30% acceptable. Rest is just to make you fall asleep in class.
Exams are held at regular intervals. Passing is not a big deal. 1 day before the exam is sufficient. However, getting a good grade is really hard."
Athira Sasi,Girideepam Institute of Advanced Learning - [GIAL],"M.Com, Finance",7.3,College Review,"The exam was about 3 hours. Some questions are so easy to understand. But some others are too difficult to understand.
