Rinkesh,Prestige Institute of Management and Research - [PIMR],"MBA, General",7.6,Transparent thoughts on Prestige,"The reason for choosing this course is to be eligible to opt for better opportunities. MBA teaches you how a business works and how do these giant corporates develop and perform. MBA is an overall development of the personality of a person. 
At Prestige Institute, Indore, I found that the faculty is very well-behaved and they are always ready to help students not only in academics but also in their personal and career development by creating solutions to their problems. Most of the faculties are PHD holders and one faculty takes care of one subject for the batch of 60 students. The teaching method is really good. Most of the teachers conduct quizzes and other classroom activities to ensure student engagement. At Prestige Institute, every year, there are 2 semesters and exams are conducted accordingly. Where in most of the subjects 60% are for internal assessment and 40% for external written examination."

Chaitanya,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Bengaluru Campus,"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",6.6,Decent college for studies only,"I choose ECE because since childhood I love physics. In +1 and +2 I got interested in wireless technology, semiconductors, etc. The ece branch is the best fit for my interests. This is the best decision  I took.
Every four years curriculum changes. As of now, the ECE curriculum is outdated.
Like every college, here also we have some good professors with good knowledge and some professors with no knowledge at all in the subject they teach. Students to faculty ratio is good.
Some faculties are having doctorates, and some are currently doing PhDs. Most professors prefer teaching using PPTs which we students don't like at all. But they are some professors who are extraordinary and don't use ppts at all and their way of teaching is very good(like DR. Abhilash sir for EMT and DR. G Kurup sir for RF).
Amrita University has a dedicated exam cell and an academic coordination cell. They both make a full semester plan before a semester starts. So, exams, and holidays are well planned (but sometimes they may change."
Parkhi,Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.4,An honest analysis of Chandigarh University,"The campus life of Cu is quite good as it has a big and beautiful campus.
There are number of events and competions in which you can participate and enjoy your college life.
You will get an opportunity to attend at least 2 events per month. But sometimes, you will not be aware of the contests as the circulation of message requires an ample amount of time on such a huge campus.
Coming onto the libraries-each block in CU has its own library and there is also one central library with the number of boooks available. Acs are available in labs but not in classes, otherwise, there are good facilities in classes too such as projectors.
Lifts are not available for students, only faculty and staff can use the lifts.
You can also join the technical clubs and many different co-curricular clubs like dance, drama, fine arts, photography etc and you can participate in various inter-department contest which takes place almost once a month."

The total batch strength for Analytics students was 28 and for HR it was 14. So faculty to student ratio of 1:42. All the faculty members have done their PhD in their respective specialization from some IIM or a reputed institute. The mode of teaching is case-based for a few subjects while practicals and simulation-based as well for those subjects where required. The total term duration is for around 12 weeks, and midterms took place somewhere around at the end of the sixth week. The end term would take place by the end of last week.

The faculty-student ratio is extremely good here as there are different teachers for different subjects in different branches and there's no same faculty teaching two branches.
Maximum teachers here are Ph.D. from IITs and foreign universities, their teaching methods are modern too as they teach using ppts, etc.
Exams are always timely here, however, syllabus completion is tough as we are in a short semester due to Covid, and also papers are not set easily, they are tough to pass. Everyone coming here must make his/her mind clear about studies because they will have to study very hard to get a good GPA."
