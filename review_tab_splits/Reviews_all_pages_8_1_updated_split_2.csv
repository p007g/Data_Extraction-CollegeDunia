We recently got the Fest 2022 where KK,Kenny Sebastian, Akash Gupta, and few more musician/bands had come and we enjoyed a lot really.
Campus life is amazing here but of course with many distractions. So, You have to be in your own self control because where there is more freedom,there is more chance to get distracted from academics.
Overall Block 5 and 6(for boys) especially will make u live in the actual hostel and feel what is a hostel life.
Campus surroundings are full of greenery and yeah you have to walk a little more here because of the distance between hostels and NLHs is a bit distant.
U have options to take buggy or cycles for rent but it s quite expensive for this distance.
You have to wisely make your friends circle or it will be disaster for you. Many Bars, Clubs and distraction places are there near MIT where most of the students go and get drunk every weekend."
