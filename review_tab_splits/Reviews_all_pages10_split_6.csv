Student (Anonymous),Training Ship Rahaman,"Certification, Catering Personnel",7.5,The briefing of TS Rahaman for Hospitality Management freshers,I chose this course because i love to cook and try and experiment new dishes on daily basis and i thought that hospitality management would be a perfect field of interest to fulfill my dreams. The faculty is too active and experienced in terms of teaching they help to clear out all the short obstacles you'll stuck to and the teaching method as of now is online due to pandemic and also they are managing it in a well organised manner by clearing out the doubts of students.

I got this college and I choose this college because of good academics and fresh environment there and also nearby there is many mechanical companies so it gets easy to interact with them. The admission process in this college is based on cet score and Jee score. Main difference between selecting this college over others was only academics here, the college give more preference to academics only. College ground is very small so no big sport event takes place. And we have to manage our own playground to play. For selecting this college I used college dunia website and colleges personal website."
Koldinny krishnaveni,Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences,"B.Sc (Nursing), Nursing",8.3,About my college - Care college of nursing,"As I am a b.sc student and as I'm availed in govt quota my academic fee per year is 40000. Otherwise, for other people who are availed in management quota, it is approximately 1 lakh per year. so as I will get a scholarship from the government, the government will pay 50-60k per year as a fee reimbursement. And also I will get the normal scholarship from the government. It will be like 5000 per year. So I can say that it is very beneficial when we are getting all these scholarships. Regarding financial support, it may be difficult for a middle-class person to pursue a degree from this college but it will be a way easier if he/she is availed in the government quota as the government will provide scholarships. And he/she can be availed in government quota if they perform very well in their entrance exams like I wrote EAMCET. Our college will also internship opportunities in our college hospital itself. As I'm my third year now, in few months I'll get the internship opportunity."

Ayan Akhtar,Aligarh Muslim University - [AMU],"MBA, General",9.4,Amazing AMU,To be specific the main reason ive choosen Aligarh Muslim University is due to my older brother he did his MTECH from AMU and Currently working at a well reputed company and the other reason is due to i belong a lower middle class family so i needed  to do a course which i can afford through my knowledge ive cleared the entrance. I've not used any website to choose othis college because i was already being part of the University as ive did my Bsc from AMU. The very good thing is i liked at AMU is the culture and Tahzeeb  and peple here are very supportive and helping  and faculties members are very helping. The bad thing i can say is the pattern of study which is old and also less number of Industrial visit.That's all i can explain about my experience and why i choose AMU.
Utpal Aman,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Information Technology",9.1,"Amazing college, peers, Campus life & placements. What else you want?","Just Amazing. Placements was the primary reason I'd chosen the college. Google, Oracle, Amazon, Flipkart, and n number of companies visit our campus. Competition is cut throat as everyone in your batch is really really good. So you'd get the opportunities but you need to perform better than peers to bag the job. Also one kid one offer policy so it's really great. Avg ctc was around 20lpa for my batch. minimum went to 8-10lpa and max went as high as 35-40lpa."

We've got 4-5 teachers every semester who dedicatedly manage all 30 students in our batch. It's surprising how the faculty has so effectively given their time and dedication to pouring knowledge and yet made it fun for us even in online mode. The teaching methods are really great. We get assignments that are really fun and which involves self-creativity. Exams were timed perfectly. If you're a student who attends every class and listens carefully to the teachers or even reads up all the notes given during class, passing isn't too difficult. I score 9 CGPA in the 1st semester without any external help and just through the means of studying and paying attention in the class."

The books are based on the old curriculum but the teaching methods are quite advanced like there is the availability of projectors and smartboards, however, this is not in all the classes but some of them but if you are taking a reputed course then you definitely get those smart classes. Now, if I talk about the exam criteria then basically in both semesters, there is a first mid semester exam of 25 marks and 15 marks of internal assignment. Then we have 60 marks of the end semester examination after it which signifies the end of any semester. You got maximum of two days to leave for successive exams of courses you have if you got lucky"

On one faculty there are almost 40 students so the ratio of faculty: students is 1:40.
All the faculties are Master's degree qualified in their respective fields. However, then, some are experienced and some are new joiners. The teaching method of all the faculties includes only theoretical methods and nobody provides practical knowledge.
Since the course is divided into the semester and in one year there are two semesters. The semester duration is from July to December and other one is from January to June.
So, in total 4 years, of course, there are 8 semesters. The examination carried out in December and June month of the respective semester. However, in the middle of the semester, sessional exams take place which is 40 marks per subject."

All types of course-related books and journals are present in the library plus extra books types literature is also present.

Like government Veterinary officer, Surgeon, clinician, a nutritionist in any feed firm, gynaecologist, etc. Some can go into academics after their PG PhD. And some even join civil services as there are many vets is also. 
Faculty: Student ratio is 1:4.
I can say this college has the best faculty from the best prestigious colleges of India like gbpuat Pantnagar, ivri izzat Nagar, duvasu Mathura, ndri karnal, etc. 
As faculty is good so the students taught by them will also be far good. And if they are taught well so the exams conducted will also be easy to crack which consist of 3 internals and 1 external per annum."

Side by Side there are also many theory subjects like Electronics, Maths etc. There are a total of 10 section (a-j) and each section is divided into 2 sub-sections, for example, a-1 and a-2. All faculties are well qualified with knowledge of their subject. Talking about the exams. Exams are from easy-medium level. Just note that everything taught in class will be asked in exams.

Trust me when I say this cause I myself was very sceptical about having chosen this field. And like me, if you have not given your ICAR exam, then why miss the opportunity Amity is providing for students? 
The department is smaller as compared to the other departments at Amity. But this gives us the added benefit of networking with our seniors and maintaining our bond with our professors.  Speaking of the faculty, they are highly qualified professors in the institute. Most of them give their best in teaching and making you understand the given topic well. They are a highly dedicated team of faculty and love it when you throw questions at them, they are always available for your doubts and can visit them in their cabin whenever you want to clarify anything. 
The exams are pretty moderate, all questions are within the syllabus and mostly what the professor teaches you in the class is asked. So the key is paying attention in classes."

Student (Anonymous),Galgotias University - [GU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.6,Experience about my college life,"All the important chapters will be there in each semester. you will not find any difficulties in understanding those chapters. Initially, you will be taught the advanced things which you had studied in the 11th and 12th class. Then the programming part will be taught from the basic. Here not all the faculties are experienced but some are too good. They have very good knowledge and the ability to teach students very well. Those teachers will teach very clearly and hence the students will be able to understand them. The examination process is like other colleges You will get 3 cat i.e tests and 1 term exam in each semester. Cat is of 30 marks and ETE is of 100 Mark's.

Kushagra Srivastava,Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology - [GCET],"B.Tech, Information Technology",5.3,,"My first choice was CSE but didn't get a Fee Waiver seat there and hence chose IT. At that time on the hindsight, I was worried about this decision of mine but now when I look back I feel it was a very good decision and both the courses are 99% similar. Faculty student ratio is pretty good. There were around 10-15 faculties for IT branch with 120 students. Many faculties were common for CSE and IT. Most of the faculties had masters degree with few having doctorate as well. Faculties were educated enough but barring one or two, rest of them had a traditional teaching style of forcing the students to memorize everything. Anyway in an engineering college, what u do outside of course curriculum matters more.
Term exams were very timely. And in my experience they were very easy to pass. Marks were given based on handwriting and how much pages u filled. No one really cared about the quality of answers."

Poojan shah,Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology - [SVIT] Vasad,"BE, Computer Engineering",8.0,MY REVIEW,"I have chosen this course because I wanted to opt for it for a better future. Although I developed an interest in this particular field during my 10th standard and was very enthusiastic to learn about it. Talking about the faculties of our college, I must say that SVIT has got really good faculty as they are highly qualified and always want their students to be ""doubtless"" in their respective teaching subjects by solving each and everyone doubts possible. The faculty-student ratio is about 1:40 approx. Moving towards how timely the term exams were and how difficult was to pass it , they were on time as mid semester exams and GTU exams are conducted in 3 months and 6 months respectively. If one has sincerely studied during the lectures and also self-studied enough then it might not appear to be that difficult."

The faculties teaching us were all senior personal and had at least 25-30 years of work experience. Many of them were having a doctorate in a specific field. 
For every subject, we were given interesting projects which involved real problems to which we had to find innovative, realistic, and feasible solutions.
Exams were conducted every three months and with such wonderful guidance of staff, we never found it difficult to pass."

We are also asked to join a lot of sessions by various industry experts on trending topics. We have access to an e-library and also get pdf of some of the important books. One thing I don't like is that we don't have any cultural society or any cultural events that happen here unlike other colleges. There are informal students clubs as per the specializations

From 2nd year all students fall under their respective schools, For example, I'm an IT student so my school is School of Computer Engineering.
There are various schools of Engineering like School of Mechanical, Civil, Electronics, Electrical etc..
In the first year, all students have the same subjects related to what they learned in class 12th but in more detail.

The faculties are excellent and very supportive.
Even in these tough times they kept us motivated for our studies and left no stone unturned.
All of the faculties were highly qualified and the majority of them did their M Tech and Ph.D. from IITs.

The exam culture is very strict at KiiT as it is governed by a central body known as the Office of the Controller of Examination.
You will get an academic calendar at the starting of the year and it is followed"

Sayantan Pal,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",10.0,Vit is No 1 college in India,"Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the streams where you learn almost all the concepts of science. You learn about electronics, a few electrical and computer science (data structure, foc and more) based concepts. The best part is the communication. I dont think any other stream gives you this diversified yet trivial knowledge of all the fields. That's the reason I chose ECE. It is mandatory to maintain a good student to faculty ratio and it varies between college to college. Our college has a student to faculty ratio of nearly 1:29. Our college has faculties and professors from all around the world. Most of them hold a Post Doctorate Degree rest of them are involved in research works. Some of them are renowned for publishing research articles and outstanding contribution to the research field."
VIBHA MISHRA,Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology - [PSIT],"MCA,",9.0,,I have completed BCA as my graduation and I have a personal interest in the IT field that's why I chose PSIT. The ratio between faculty and student is high. Most of the teachers have completed their post-graduation and some of them have completed Ph.D. So all teachers have enough knowledge to teach the students and they teach in such a way that it helps the students to understand the concepts very effectively. The course is very verified as it covers all the important topics and subjects that help the most during the placement drive.

The green lawns and stone benches are a pleasing sight. Many events take place in the university. The annual fest is named Kuruksastra. Also, huge events are conducted for sports and culture. The university has lots of canteens where you can get good food. The university has a football court, basketball court, volleyball court, gymnasium, library. The library is great. There are lots of books which are truly helpful. There was cricket ground before but now a new building is being raised there. So that is a lack. An indoor stadium named Maruti stadium is also available for indoor games. It has air-conditioned auditoriums. Many events and club activities come up and the campus environment is also good, so campus life is pretty good."
Ashneet kaur,Jagannath International Management School - [JIMS] Kalkaji,,9.5,Perfect JIMS,I chose BBA because my interest areas are marketing and finance. So BBA provides you full knowledge about marketing and finance. The faculties of the college are all professionals in their fields. Some of them are degree holders as well. Internal and externals are 2 types of examinations held. Internals are held by the college for 25 marks where 15 marks are for written tests and rest 10 marks are for assignments and your interaction in class. Externals are conducted by the university itself by the end of each semester and are of 75 marks.
Rhea Prabhakaran,SIES School of Business Studies - [SIES SBS],"PGDM, General",4.3,"Good Curriculum, High Fees, No Amenities, Mediocre to Poor Placement (use references instead)","In terms of the curriculum, PGDM is the best compared to MMS. Much wider portion, very knowledgeable faculty, and all are very helpful and easily approachable. No electives are available even though it is mentioned on the site. Also SIES SBS is still in process of being approved by AICTE so there is no organization that can intervene during problems.

Students are very diverse from all backgrounds. 50% are South Indians and the rest of the majority are Maharashtrians along with other folks, friendly (No impact on student interaction).

In terms of teaching quality, 50% Faculty is amazing, 50% are either mediocre or poor. Not open to constructive feedback.
Best faculty are from Marketing and HR. Marketing is given most importance in extra-curricular; faculty encourages students to join marketing as placement is highest and easier (But only choose as per your interest).

Exam was online and written, no camera or supervision. Lengthy paper & 2 hours. Easy to pass but not easy to get highest score."

But there were eligibility criteria where a student must obtain 8 and above CGPA with no backlogs to move to the willing stream of his/hers. With the help of faculty and other college authorities, I could land in my dream stream CSE.

Faculties are very friendly and teach us the topics any number of times without any hesitation. They are the major pillars of our college and they are the reason behind the success of the college.

Qualification of faculties is Ph.D., MS, BTech. The teaching method is really good. As we are engineering graduates, even we are allowed to explain the topics in the form of seminars."

My department ( EE ) has very good well-qualified faculty members who are very friendly with students. The student to teacher ratio till 2nd year was 60:1 per class and it went upto 70:1 ( because of lateral entry ) since 3rd year. Every teacher has their unique teaching method and it is very exciting. There are 2 term exams in each semester. First term with first half of syllabus ( of a particular semester ) and second term ( with second half of syllabus ( of a particular semester ). The question level of exams are pretty average. But the semester exams are quite difficult."
