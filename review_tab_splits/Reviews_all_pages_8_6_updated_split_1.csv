Faculty during the TEQIP program were highly qualified from different IITs and NITs, although there were a couple of bad teachers there were also some good teachers as you'd find in every college. The permanent faculty was quite good and helpful, especially Dr. Ganpat Sir (HOD of Civil Eng.).

sumit kumar,Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Sciences - [SHUATS],"B.Tech, Biotechnology",8.2/10,SHUATS (btech.biotech) Awesome,"Earlier I was confused with B.sc Ag. and B.tech Biotech. B.tech biotech has been an emerging field in India, as it has already boomed in other foreign countries but in India it has a lot to grow. After all these B.tech in biotech is a much better course for a bio student as nowadays B.sc. Ag. has already started to get a rush in this stream of students and very soon the opportunities will decline. So, that why i choose BTech in Biotechnology .

Faculty and student ratio is also good because a lot of faculty are there to help you in your academics.


Most of the Faculty members are highly qualified and thier teaching method is also so good,they give priority to the practical knowledge rather than just talking about the books.

Term exams are also timely and if u have been studying a little but continuosly than you will pass the examination easily."

The placement cell is always successful to attract more than 100+ companies for placement. due to the hard work of the placement cell the college placement record is 100%. Companies like Jaro, Amazon, Accenture, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Mahindra visit the campus during the placement drive. The highest package for our batch was 12 LPA and the average package was around 7 LPA. I receive the package of 10 LPA from Mahindra which was really worth the money."
Divyanshi Awasthi,University Maharani College,"BA {Hons.}, Psychology",6.3/10,"College is good, but meet the expectations.",I chose psychology as my subject because there are so many opportunities in this field and it's an interesting subject too. The psychology faculty is not so good in this college. Classes aren't regularly held and they appoint teachers at the end of the year. Although teachers are highly qualified and good at their work this college needs more psychology teachers. Exams were postponed due to covid and they were pretty tough but if someone did their preparation all year long then it was not that hard for them.
Prakhar Pandey,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,8.6/10,NIT Agartala,"From the second semester onwards, students are eligible for the management programme.

Every year they arrange Saptrang fest in which organize so skill full things.  In our college, they organized workshops and guest lectures on a week or month basis. Every week they organized a workshop.  In Library they have so many books and journals in the library we can go n issue with I'd card. All engineering books are so expensive so we can't buy all the books so we can borrow them from the library. We can take a book for 15 days after that will take 1rs per day late fees. In huge numbers, they are providing books for students. We can use computer labs and all labs, data for the study."
Nishi Singh,R.S Mundle Dharampeth Arts and Commerce College,"BA, General",1.7/10,Good College to take admission,"No annual fest or tech fest get together conducted in college though they should conduct any of the programs.

Availability of books and journalism in the library through the library is small we have peace and can read any of the books we can find so many books regarding anything even they have notes for our subject if we wish to issue the books we can issue by our library card 
Till the time we want to read or if we wish to keep the book for a long time we can ask the librarian for help. 
There are no sports conducted in college they don’t Have big ground in college how come they will even think of conducting any of the sports.
No social group, clubs or website for students they are not allowed to make any group.
Campus life is boring the building is very old the classroom doesn’t even have proper electricity no light the fans keep hanging no hygiene not a good washroom unhygienic."

Every class is a digital class with a system and a projector. The classes have a proper lighting system and ventilation. The college always supports students with extracurricular skills.

The course's content is evaluated and produced by students, and it is kept up to date with respect to the present business environment."
Student (Anonymous),Jagannath International Management School - [JIMS] Kalkaji,"PGDM, International Business",4.8/10,College Review,"To be honest the course curriculum is okay just like any either college. Very less emphasis on practical learning out of 100, 80 marks are directly your written theory paper.
The student-faculty ratio is fine. But please be ready to face the toxic political environment.
There are quite a few great faculty at JIMS like Dr.Neelam, Dr. Sanjeela, Dr. Shruti, and Dr. Navneet. You will gain maximum real-life and practical knowledge."

Student (Anonymous),Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.2/10,A review of JECRC by a JECRCian,"For placements students become eligible at the end of the 3rd year before this student have to can do an internship in different companies. 
In this college, many good companies come like TCS, Accenture, HP, Google, Microsoft and many other reputed companies. The highest package was Rs44 lpa given by Amazon to a student and HP hired 11 students with the package of Rs 11 LPA. 
College helps very much in placement activities. Students with less percentage are even placed with the package of Rs 3 LPA. 
Computer science has almost 100% placements as compared to other branches. For good placements, students have to be good in the coding part, data structure and algorithm, C language and any other language they know. Before placements, training is given to all the students on how to present themselves in placement interviews. But this is helpful to only some extent. 
After B.tech if I get placed with a good package then I will do that job otherwise I will go with M.tech in computer science"
Student (Anonymous),L.D. College of Engineering - [LDCE],"BE, Information Technology",7.2/10,One of the best engineering college in gujrat,"I was interested in the computer science field but due to my low ranking I got information technology, I am happy because there is no difference between CSE and IT. Faculty to student ratio is decent not too good & not too bad. Teachers are qualified from reputed institutes & most of them are Ph.D., but teaching style is decent, some teachers are really good while some are really bad, the main issue is the old syllabus and old methods of teaching in all engineering colleges in India. Exams are taken in 2 phases in the semester.
1. mid sem exam
2. end sem exam 
The difficulty of exams depends on faculty some, exams are easy while others are extremely lengthy and tough too."
Ayush Kumar,Dronacharya Group of Institutions - [DGI],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.8/10,Excellent college for studies,"Fees of the college

2,3,4,year= 93800
There are university fees which are paid by students every year and it is 7800.
In my college, the placement opportunity is excellent because you can sit in 4 to 5 companies exams and interviews and it gives us more opportunities to get placed in a good company at the good package.
We get the scholarship by up government every year of rs 50000."

In the case of the library, many books are not available for the students who are not purchased from the market they expect to issue books from the library but because of no availability of books, they have to purchase new ones from the market. And library pass is also generated from college for students to issue books.

There are more than 40 faculties available in my department  and students in my class are around 45 
Well, some of the teachers are extremely good while some are not. honestly speaking every teacher's aim is to finish the syllabus as soon as possible and yes some teachers teach you very good but their primary goal is to complete the syllabus as soon as possible so I personally believe this syllabus or theory-based approach is not soo good for management students.
Exams are conducted semester-wise. First semester exams are usually conducted in February- march or the second semester in july -august. The exam pattern changes every year like there is always a compulsory question and 8 more questions from which you have to attempt only 4. do from 9 questions you have to do 5 questions for 80 marks.
paper is moderate and questions come from the syllabus."

Student (Anonymous),Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.3/10,"Thapar University, Computer Science and Engineering Course Review","The B.E. Computer Science and Engineering is the second-best course in the college in my opinion after the B.E. computer science course. Yes, these are two different courses. At the time of admission, the first one was the one that I could get into based on my marks and rank. Both the courses have the same course material taught, only the latter has more students admitted and thus has more competition amongst peers. Every branch is divided into batches of 60 students approx. for lectures and 30 for labs, each having one teaching staff which makes the faculty: student ratio pretty good. The exams in Thapar are divided into sessional and mid term and final term exam. Before each term exam you have a sessional exam/quiz for each subject taught and a lab evaluation(which is counted into sessional exam) if the subject has practical credits. So the exams happen very frequently and is relatively easy to pass if you perform average in every test but the term exams are still moderately difficult."

Girls who become too much confident, fearless, and vocal as human being no matter how she looks, from where she is, and what language she speaks. Lsr gives a unique power to everyone, to stand for justice, to speak for right, to fight for yourself. Magic of lsr is within every lsrite. The magic of lsr is because of every lsrite.

Mausam kumar,KS Institute of Technology - [KSIT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",6.8/10,An honest review,"As I'm in 1st semester. I will update you after my exams. But one good thing is that from this year, internals and externals will hold same weightage i.e., 50/50 
If you can score more than 45% in internals which wouldn't be that big of a deal because they'll ask most the questions from class notes. 
Most of the faculties are average I would say. But some are good professors too.
I chose CSE because I find these topics interesting since junior school. And everyone is just jumping into cse is a reason too lol."

Student (Anonymous),Lady Shri Ram College for Women - [LSR],"BA {Hons.}, Economics",3.4/10,Half College experience,"I choose Economics Honours from LSR because it gives a backup option for placement if at all I'm not able to crack UPSC. However, the reality is different. Only students from privileged backgrounds got exposure to opportunities. There is almost 1 teacher for a class of 50 students. 70% of the Faculty isn't good, to be honest. They hardly have enthusiasm towards the subject and online classes are very boring. We have 2 teachers for a few subjects, stating the reason that if two teachers teach simultaneously different chapters, the course would be covered soon."

HARSH,Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College - [AKGEC],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.8/10,Average college in ghaziabad,"Since I'm in the first year so no internship I opted for, in campus Internships are very few, students avail off-campus Internships.
Paid Internships (where you pay and do not get paid) are offered by companies like HPES, NIIT, etc where they teach you a new tech and then give you a project to execute. True they give you no exposure into how the industry operates and are a classroom program themselves, but your knowledge gets a boost which is helpful in the 4th year when placements start. With HPES, learn android application development, and was asked a lot about it."

Ema,SRM University Sikkim,"B.Sc, Chemistry",8.0/10,Rivew on SRM University,"Ngl some of the faculty in my department was above excellent. They have their graduation degree from renowned institutes like IIT and they have pursued their MSc and Ph.D. from renowned foreign universities. However, not all profs are excellent. Some students don't understand their way of teaching but the plus point is that the university has always a session in which you can review on teachers. You can utilize this opportunity. If your teacher isn't good enough for you all you can surely replace them or you can request them to change their way of teaching without hesitation. They'll never know your name so rate them without hesitation. There are a total of 6 exams per year. 2-semester exam, 2 module exam & 2 cycle test. Module exams & semester exams are alike. The only difference is that the module is converted into 20 marks. They provide a laboratory for different departments. Our chemistry lab is highly maintained along with a lab assistant to help and guide students."
