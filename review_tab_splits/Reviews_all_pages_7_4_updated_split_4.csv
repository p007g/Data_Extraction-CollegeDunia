Tulsi,Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology  - [MANIT],"B.Tech, Metallurgical And Materials Engineering",4.8,"Maulana Azad National Institute Of Technology, Bhopal","Honestly speaking this course that I chose was not by choice it's just what I got in the counselling process. The faculty students ratio is average in our college. For the first year, it will be like 1 teacher per 115 students but from next year it becomes branch-specific mostly it used to be 1 teacher for  75 students. But there is no class teacher, there are subject-specific teachers in each class but class teachers are not there. The faculties are well qualified they are all doctorates and the classes take place on digital boards. The term exams take place on time but regular attention in class and a bit more effort will surely help to pass the exam easily. The level of paper seems moderate and is mostly based on what is being taught in the class. So attention in class is necessary."
