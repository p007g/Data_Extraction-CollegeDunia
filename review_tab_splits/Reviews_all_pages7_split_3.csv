Amit Rana,THDC Institute of Hydro Power Engineering and Technology,"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",5.0,Experience of thdcihet colleges Tehri,I choose this course due to my interest in the engineering field. The faculty are amazing and have very awareness among them. They are very knowledgeable in their field of expertise. Qualification for the faculty is pretty high everyone either graduate from NIT or IIT. Two types of exams happen in one semester one being called internal which is checked and made by teachers of THDC and the second one being external which is issued by UTU and checked outside of THDC premises. Internal takes place usually after the half-semester is completed and externally takes place after the whole semester is ended. Both are pretty tough but studying routinely will help you score well.
gyanesh sharma,P. R. Pote Patil College of Engineering and Management - [PRPCEM],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",2.3,Beginning of new journey,"The college follows the regular fee structure. The details of college fees are shared with students on regular basis. The class-wise WhatsApp groups and hard copy notices are taken out to communicate scholarship details to students. There are parents' WhatsApp groups as well. The scholarship information is also given to parents. The best part is two instalments are given to pay the fees. Counsellors also keep even communication with parents. This is a big relief for all as paying fees one time becomes very difficult. Since Amravati as a city/town is not expensive to live the cost of the study is in an affordable range. All the government scholarships such as SC, ST, OBC, VJNT etc are available in college. Scholarship updates are given to students on regular basis from the principal office. Like Pandit Din Daya Upadhyay Scholarship, Rajshri Sahu and many others.

VANDANA YADAV,Ashoka University,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Biology",8.8,Join Ashoka to explore,"I feel the biology course is very good at Ashoka. The faculty members are approachable and helpful. There are nine labs for biology itself where a lot many types of research are going on about different topics. From your second semester itself, you can apply for internships and can work under professors on different research. The faculty: student ratio is very good here. Because few students joined Ashoka for sciences as they misunderstood Ashoka as a university for only social sciences, the batch size is small and every student has an opportunity. 
I loved the teaching methods and the assistance provided. Besides the professor and assistant professor, there is a teaching fellow to help you out in case you need them.
