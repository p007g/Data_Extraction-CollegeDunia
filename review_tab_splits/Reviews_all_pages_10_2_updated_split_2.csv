Shikha,Daulat Ram College - [DRC],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Mathematics",8.2,My college experience,"The fee for the maths course is 18370 per year. The fee is quite in comparison to colleges like Hansraj, KMC, Hindu. The reason is DRC is a semi-government college. Personally, I was receiving a scholarship from a private organisation so I didn't gave any problem. There is no such scholarship provision, but the college provides some concessions for underprivileged students including the PWD. The PWD students have to pay around 100 per year. They receive scholarships from the government. They also have been given free computer classes. There are some private scholarships for girls and EWS students."

Jayant Sharma,Guru Nanak Institute of Technology - [GNIT],,6.3,Average Gnit alumni,"I studied electronics and instrumentation, but to be honest, be taking admission in this department I didn't even hear, I visited this college to take admission in ECE but since there were very few students in EIE they told me that there are no seats left in ECE or any other department and insisted me to choose it since both ECE and EIE have so much in common, and I  thought if I get more than 8.5 cgpa I can change my stream after the first year, but it didn't happen.
Some of the teachers were highly qualified and experienced and some of them were not so much experienced although they were good. Few teacher's English wasn't that good I felt that.
Exams were rightly timed and were managed really well however in my experience seating arrangement was the same in all four years i.e I used to sit on the second bench. The difficulty of examinations was not too much, if you study even 1 day before the exam you can at least easily get the passing marks but scoring is difficult  in the first yr."

Faculty: student ratio is quite small and I guess that's a common issue with most of the IITs and colleges in India. We have 2 quizzes and 1 endsem for every course. But that does change depending on the prof who is teaching the course, some may have only endsem, some prefer projects and paper presentation. Most of the courses have relative grading. So, even if the paper is tough, it's tough for everyone, and so your grade depends on how well you performed compared to your batchmates."

Rahul Bisht,"GB Pant Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University, Okhla-III Campus","Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",6.6,The Gooder threads,"For me, it was good for my life.
Professors looked less like professors, but more like members of GB pant. People were extremely narrow-minded. Placements - I better not speak of them. Add to the woes, the freedom restriction. The monopoly of shopkeepers. I would have forgiven everything if only we had proper wi-fi. I felt we were isolated from the whole world. When the engineering students of the whole world were making busy making engineering breakthroughs, we were thinking of breaking."

Under these conditions, if you are eligible you will get the scholarship.
There are also state scholarship and minority scholarship.
For campus placement, CS, EE, ECE has the advantage over CE, ME.

Student (Anonymous),Aligarh Muslim University - [AMU],"B.Tech, Computer Engineering",6.4,Extraordinary AMU,"I choose this course because mostly this course contains placements and also because of studying in my own home town. Now, if I talk about the student's faculty ratio then it is around 3:1 which is quite good and there is the availability of some good faculty members who have very good qualifications also like PhDs from reputed IIT and some are having international PhDs. The books are based on the old curriculum but the teaching methods are quite advanced like there is the availability of projectors and smartboards, however, this is not in all the classes but some of them but if you are taking a reputed course then you definitely get those smart classes. Now, if I talk about the exam criteria then basically in both semesters, there is a first mid semester exam of 25 marks and 15 marks of internal assignment. Then we have 60 marks of the end semester examination after it which signifies the end of any semester. You got maximum of two days to leave for successive exams of courses you have if you got lucky"
Gulshan Singh Bhati,Aravali College of Engineering and Management - [ACEM],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",6.7,,"I have chosen Electronics and Communication Engineering course because at that time this field is in the trending phase and I want to build a career in this field.
On one faculty there are almost 40 students so the ratio of faculty: students is 1:40.
All the faculties are Master's degree qualified in their respective fields. However, then, some are experienced and some are new joiners. The teaching method of all the faculties includes only theoretical methods and nobody provides practical knowledge.
Since the course is divided into the semester and in one year there are two semesters. The semester duration is from July to December and other one is from January to June.
So, in total 4 years, of course, there are 8 semesters. The examination carried out in December and June month of the respective semester. However, in the middle of the semester, sessional exams take place which is 40 marks per subject."
Aaradhya Dev,"Gautam Buddha University, School of Management","MBA, Business Analytics",7.6,Gautam buddha university in my words,"Abhivyanjana is the annual fest and many other fests like Shauryautsav performed it's like almost 10 fests have been performed per year. 
All types of course-related books and journals are present in the library plus extra books types literature is also present. 
The sports quality of the university is 10 out of 10 you got 10 different grounds that are huge. 
Students can join many clubs and societies like NCC NSS placement drive dance Nukkad Natak social group as their extracurricular activities."
Tushar Mittal,Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology,"B.V.Sc, Animal Husbandry",10.0,Best vet college in coming years,"One should be an animal lover if they want to go long in this field according to me. 
As options are surplus after graduation.
Like government Veterinary officer, Surgeon, clinician, a nutritionist in any feed firm, gynaecologist, etc. Some can go into academics after their PG PhD. And some even join civil services as there are many vets is also. 
Faculty: Student ratio is 1:4.
I can say this college has the best faculty from the best prestigious colleges of India like gbpuat Pantnagar, ivri izzat Nagar, duvasu Mathura, ndri karnal, etc. 
As faculty is good so the students taught by them will also be far good. And if they are taught well so the exams conducted will also be easy to crack which consist of 3 internals and 1 external per annum."

Side by Side there are also many theory subjects like Electronics, Maths etc. There are a total of 10 section (a-j) and each section is divided into 2 sub-sections, for example, a-1 and a-2.

No topic out of the syllabus will be asked. Exams are quite frequent. We have 3 Fa's, 3 St's and 1 End term Exam.

The library is another thing I like about my college, the only problem is sitting facilities otherwise, it provides all sorts of books and journals, organised properly.
Classrooms are spacious, with good quality seats, well-established lights and fans.
Sports are also given support. We have a sports meet every year for freshers in September. It offers different types of games and helps freshers to get along with each other and make friends.
There are different societies, like Dance, Drama Fine Arts, Gandhi Study Circle, Political on Toast, NSS. NCC and many more. These societies help students to enhance their knowledge and mind."

Bidhya Shree,Amity Institute of Organic Agriculture - [AIOA],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Agriculture",8.5,"An in-depth view of Amity Institute of Organic Agriculture, Noida","Agriculture further has lots of scopes. Trust me when I say this cause I myself was very sceptical about having chosen this field. And like me, if you have not given your ICAR exam, then why miss the opportunity Amity is providing for students? 
The department is smaller as compared to the other departments at Amity. But this gives us the added benefit of networking with our seniors and maintaining our bond with our professors.  Speaking of the faculty, they are highly qualified professors in the institute. Most of them give their best in teaching and making you understand the given topic well. They are a highly dedicated team of faculty and love it when you throw questions at them, they are always available for your doubts and can visit them in their cabin whenever you want to clarify anything. 
The exams are pretty moderate, all questions are within the syllabus and mostly what the professor teaches you in the class is asked. So the key is paying attention in classes."

Student (Anonymous),Galgotias University - [GU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.6,Experience about my college life,"All the important chapters will be there in each semester. you will not find any difficulties in understanding those chapters. Initially, you will be taught the advanced things which you had studied in the 11th and 12th class. Then the programming part will be taught from the basic. Here not all the faculties are experienced but some are too good. They have very good knowledge and the ability to teach students very well. Those teachers will teach very clearly and hence the students will be able to understand them. The examination process is like other colleges You will get 3 cat i.e tests and 1 term exam in each semester. Cat is of 30 marks and ETE is of 100 Mark's.

DEBLINA SEN,Guru Nanak Institute of Technology - [GNIT],"B.Tech, Food Technology",10.0,GNIT review,"I am a student in the 4th year food technology department of GNIT. After my higher secondary exam, I attempted WBJEE. Through counseling, I got the opportunity to get admission to the food technology department in GNIT. As I had biology in classes 11 and 12 and biology was my favorite subject, so I decided to get admission to this department. After admission, I realized all the faculty members of this department are extremely helpful and cooperative. Their teaching methods are very very impressive. All the topics are explained by them in detail and if any student has any doubt they clear it immediately. So we do not find any difficulty during the exam. Moreover, the lab assistants explain each and every experiment in detail. Now, in this pandemic situation, our online classes are ongoing. In the online classes, our teachers always follow the best way to make us understand and to have a clear idea on each and every topic."

So we have canteens for everyone to avail food at a pocket-friendly price. We have two rich libraries and individual departmental libraries that reduce the headache of buying expensive books. Students can access the J store, several journal websites, etc also. Professors also help the students with required study materials. Inter-departmental access is very easy here. Students' organizations have their own freshers programs individually but the annual college fest, named Milieu is organized by the students' union. Though for the current time being, it's not possible to organize the annual college fest. We have separate sports and cultural fests too organized by the respective societies under the union.

Zayn,Walchand College of Engineering - [WCE],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.3,Review-Walchand College of Engineering,"I chose CSE due to my interest in problem-solving and programming. Good placements and better ROI are some of the reasons which made me choose this college. Our college has been a government-aided college that has a problem with the faculty: student ratio. There is a clear lack of faculty. The faculty: student ratio is 70:1. Although, the available faculty is quite experienced. Most of the faculty members are Ph.D. holders, while, some are pursuing it. Also, the teaching is quite precise.
Due to the revamp in curriculum, the course has been updated considering the demand of the industry. Also, the exam pattern has been changed by adding MCQs, etc. The term exams were taken on time. Terms exams were proctored and technical issues were entertained."

There are about 100 students for one faculty of a subject but faculties are very good and also teach very well. They are taking doubt sessions from time to time and also clears doubts in regular lectures also. Faculties here are teaching for a very long time and almost all faculties have done Ph.D. in their respective fields. Few Teachers are also with Master's Degree but They are also teaching very well. Currently teaching is done online but still, they have managed to make it effective as they can.
