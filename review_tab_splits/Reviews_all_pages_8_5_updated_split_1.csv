Easha Azad,Indraprastha College for Women - [IP],"B.A {Hons.}, Multi Media and Mass Communication",5.5,"BMMMC,IPCW Detailed Honest Review","I took this course because I didn't want to pursue BA in some heavily theoretical subject like political science or history.

The thing about BMMMC is that it tries to cover many different subjects from completely different fields in each semester. 
Its downside is that you just get to touh the surface of each subject but never get to master it enough to make use of it. 
You will have papers like Development communication, Communication Research, Anchoring for news and radio, EVS, theatre, photography, Graphic Designing, Introduction to Journalism etc.


The faculty isn't very qualified. They often hire ex students as teachers. 

Wouldn't name anyone but one lecturer in particular is very rude and sadistic, and she will be teaching you and over through the semesters. Though other lectures are nice and polite.

•Exams
I gave Obe exams and they are very easy to pass."

Due to pandemics, the cultural or annual tech fest was not conducted regularly on time. In the first year, we got the book on time which means before the start of the academic syllabus. But in the second year, they are providing the books at the end of the semester. Also, they are saying that it is compulsory to take the books for every student and they have to pay the book fees. I think this is not fair and the faculty should think about this problem. Sports or extracurricular activities are not supported much."

The student-faculty ratio is 1:61. Most of the faculties are well qualified, they are M-Tech or PhDs, but there are some teachers who are freshers as well. The college follows a semester pattern, with 2 unit tests in each semester of 20 marks each. The passing percentage is 40. So if the exam is of 20 marks, the passing is 7. The semester exams are of 80 marks, with passing at 32 marks. It isn't that difficult to pass the exams if you are clear with the concepts and have understood them well. You can write the answers on your own, the teachers are considerate enough."

This is a 3-year diploma course. I chose this course as I am interested in the computer science world and in programming. I would like to give the faculty of this college full marks because the teachers always gave their best to teach us. They always wanted to give us the best of their knowledge. There are many educated Teachers in the college, most of them are post graduated and also have doctorate degrees. Faculty: student ratio is very good since the teachers do not scold like in the schools, they share a very friendly nature with students. In 3 years we have 6 semesters so Exams are held every 5-6 months and honestly the difficulty of the main exams is average, but the marking system is very hard. The board hardly gives a maximum of 40 marks from 50 (very rarely). So, always study hard."

All the faculty members have a good qualification like ph.D in their respective fields. Reviews for the teaching and non teaching staff are taken often

Student (Anonymous),Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",4.0,Honest IIIT Una review,"The faculty members are inexperienced they are helpful but won't be able to help much. I would say it will take 3-4 years for the college to get good placement statistics as its alumni network matures. The college does not appear in the NIRF ranking yet and will take 2-3 years for that. The lack of NIRF ranking hinders companies from visiting campus and qualifies it as tier 3 college hence the poor placement yet few students get good off-campus placement in companies like DE Shaw, Google, CISCO, PayPal, Microsoft. The marking is very strict as the college follows relative marking. If you do not get a good GPA in the first year you are almost doomed for the rest."

Saransh sharma,ABES Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,ABES Review,"I would like to say that there are not so many internship opportunities but yet college faculty is trying to improve internship opportunities and if some students was unable to get an internship so college faculty help those students to make some effective projects so that their CVs make some impact. And there are some internship opportunities for the college students but there are very less seats for the students so many of the students are unable to get the seats booked for themself and if someone can get an internship then he/she will pei provided internship certificate as well as stipend based on your performance. But in my experience, if you want an internship then you have to grab an internship by yourself and there are so many sites and apps that regularly make announcements of the internship some of these I like to mention are LinkedIn, Internshala etc. In college, you have to make a different project which is the minor and major project you have to minor and major projects on your own in 2 and 4 years respectively."

Priyanshu Raushan,K.K. Polytechnic,"Polytechnic, Electrical Engineering",6.3,Honest Review of my college after Experience.,": I choose this course because of my interest in Electrical Field. I love to learn about Electricity and its application in the modern Era.

: There are Enough faculty to solve any problem realted with their academics but they are not interested in your activities outside your classroom. The ratio is 1:40

: The faculties are well educated and have M.tech degree holders so they have the idea to explain the topics properly but the only bad thing is they not try again if someone not follows them in first explanation.

: There are two internal and one external exams are taken every semester in which internal exams are taken after every two months which is organised by college and the external exam is taken at the last of semester which is organised by the Board Jharkhand University of technology.
The internal exams are not so difficult because if you have attended all lectures then you can easily pass it. The main challenge is external exam in which you to do hard work to secure good mark"
