Reshal Gupta,Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government Medical College,"MBBS,",8.5,All you need to know about the college,"It is a government college and hence has fixed fees. At the time of admission 1lakh rupees are submitted as the college fee for the whole year. Besides this there was 12000 hostel fee, 5600 for co-curricular activities and separate mess fee. The students getting the benefit of scholarship don't have to pay college fee, but the other amounts are to ge given. The scholarship is mostly reservation based but there is a medhavi chhatra yojana in our state which allows poor but talented students, who got more than 85% in their boards to study free of cost in any college of M.P. but I couldn't get this benefit because our annual household income was a bit greater than their margins. Anyways, the students getting these benefits have to do an extra year of scholarship. The bonds are filed at the time of admission for rural service and if it's taken back then the penalty amount needs to be paid. But it is quiet low as compared to that of a private medical college, which charges around 10 lakh peryear"

Rohit kalwane,Yash Institute of Pharmacy,"B.Pharma,",8.0,The best pharmacy college in Aurangabad,"When you go away to college for the first time, you want to make sure you're prepared. You may be living on your own for the first time, so there could be some items you wouldn't normally consider taking because someone at home, such as a parent or guardian, usually takes care of them for you.  Consult your college acceptance literature for any specific items your college asks you to bring. If you're able, touch base with your roommate prior to school to make sure you're not bringing duplicates of large items such as TVs, couches or refrigerators. Having double will just take up space and make for a less comfortable environment.
There are much more books are available in the library related to course and also not related to course.
The various sports and extra curriculum activities are taken by the college like cricket holly ball badminton.and in extra curriculum activities they appriciat singing dancing speeches . Essays.

Faculty are really friendly, if anyone attends a class of them, a minute later they will be discussing like a friend about the topics and moreover they teach outside the textbook they are over open to students opinion it's like more friendly and, most of the faculty have atleast a decade of industrial experience overall have done their Ph.D. and very few are pursuing yet, it's really good to learn more practical instead of attending a bore theory classes.

Anybody who opted for a hostel had to pay for the hostel and mess charges which were about 80000 per year. This hostel charge is excluding that 9.5 lakh which is only the course fee.
But personally, I didn't opt for the hostel as I got a flat nearby the college which was more comfortable and gave me privacy.
College also offers scholarships to its students, both on the basis of their intermediate marks and semester marks too.
Any student securing more than 70% in their intermediate got a scholarship of 15k per year and there was a 10k increase after a 10% increase in marks.

Student (Anonymous),Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences - [Karunya Deemed University],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",4.4,A honest review about Karunya University,"The college is all about worship 24x7. The management believes that the talent had been gifted to you and the favour should be returned through worshipping 24x7. The number of fees that you are paying, the inter/intracultural events and extracurricular activities are expected to be there but the management would allow it only if it is conducted in a spiritual manner. In terms of Sport, it is well maintained. The only option you get, to showcase your talent is through worship and only that is valued there. The management does not provide a secular atmosphere, especially for the number of fees we are asked to pay which is definitely ridiculous and not worth it. Even our farewell was another worship which was disappointing to most of the people. Since there isn't a permanent classroom as per the system you usually don't get the choice of emotionally bonding with your classmates. You can only pretend that since you are paying a lot."

Student (Anonymous),Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences - [Karunya Deemed University],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",4.4,A honest review about Karunya University,"The college is all about worship 24x7. The management believes that the talent had been gifted to you and the favour should be returned through worshipping 24x7. The number of fees that you are paying, the inter/intracultural events and extracurricular activities are expected to be there but the management would allow it only if it is conducted in a spiritual manner. In terms of Sport, it is well maintained. The only option you get, to showcase your talent is through worship and only that is valued there. The management does not provide a secular atmosphere, especially for the number of fees we are asked to pay which is definitely ridiculous and not worth it. Even our farewell was another worship which was disappointing to most of the people. Since there isn't a permanent classroom as per the system you usually don't get the choice of emotionally bonding with your classmates. You can only pretend that since you are paying a lot."

Difficulty level of end term exam will increase as semester increase."
