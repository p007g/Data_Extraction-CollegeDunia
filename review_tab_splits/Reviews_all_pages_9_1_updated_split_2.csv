The pattern is revised frequently to meet the increasing standards of the industry. Much emphasis goes on labs and research works, which make the students stand among the top engineering brains of the country. The core subjects are introduced from the 2nd semester itself which helps students to understand their course in depth. Only necessary courses are included.The faculty is highly experienced, supportive and always ready to help(even during online classes). ECE branch is divided into 2 sections, which makes the teacher-student ratio 1:60. But there also are teaching assistants who are one mail way from helping us. Some professors are highly interactive and motivating, with great passion for their subject, while some- not so much. The teaching method during online classes is usually very restricted so cannot comment much upon that, but it is still very satisfactory. Again, depends on the professor.According to the new ordinance, the system of CCLCAA ( continuous and comprehensive evaluation) implemented from 2018 onwards, frequent quizzes, viva-voce and examination take place, all of which add up in the CGPA and SGPA. There are 3 major examination in a semester C1, C2 and C3. C1 and C2 constitute of 30% weightage each and the C3 exam has 40% weightage. It is essential to pass the first 2 examinations to appear in the C3(end semester).The level of the examinations is what one expects from one of the top colleges of the country.

Student (Anonymous),Aliah University,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",4.8,Aliah University - From the perspective of a student,"There is no annual tech fest or any fests. This is the area where our university totally lacks. So if you're getting your hopes high for college life, be sure to get disappointed. There is literally no social life or fun activities here. No sports facility, especially for girls. This university is very backward in terms of extracurricular. There are no proper courts for basketball, football, badminton, etc. There is nothing for sports. The funding is not less for the university, but due to laziness and inefficiency, and corruption of the administration, nothing is ever done. Every year, the administration promises to build the courts, but they've never met. 
There are no clubs or societies run by students, but in recent years, students are trying to make one, but in this too, the administration makes it extremely difficult. There is too much politics on campus and is the only thing that is visible.
If you're looking for normal college life, this isn't for you. You cannot have fun at all."

Professors and HOD are very much helpful and kind-hearted. Although they are not all interactive to the students, if you have any problems you can contact the HOD and professors without any hesitation. 
Regarding academics I can if you are not teacher dependent to understand your subject then go for it, in fact, go for any such government colleges, but if you need special attention and focus towards yourself then go for private colleges.

I would say I have attended classes in my previous college also but the kind of teachers and the students that are here is pretty much different. Basically because of 2 reasons. First, we have the same teachers so they provide us with any help and are so much friendly. Second, it's the main campus college so college life is different. Since admission took place based partly on entrance and 12th exams, the students are kind of studious."

SHANKHADEEP ROY,TAPMI Manipal,,9.1,TAPMI shining during the COVID pandemic,"I naturally flock around people, making connections and networking, and generally curious about the mechanics of the market and business. The obvious choice for me would be management, especially in marketing.

The faculties here are extremely qualified. That is one aspect there has been no compromise about and there are no two opinions about it. Thoroughly experienced faculties with dynamic teaching methods as well as a robust faculty review method keep the course improvements on the fly. We have reviews about their teaching methods for every section of the batch to suit every section accordingly and it is incorporated keeping the identity of students obscure.

Term exams were moderate, but since MBA is a residential course with enough pre-reads before every class and compulsory class participation, every student is thorough with the syllabi and the topics. So there is no cramming up before the exams but passing them isn't a breeze and sincere effort is reqired, albeit lower amplitude"

For physics, this is one of the best colleges affiliated with the University of Calcutta. I gave the entrance exam of physics in 2018, and it was my dream to study in this college. I never thought that I will get admission here, but I was lucky to be selected here. The entrance exam was conducted for Physics only. Other departments select students on the basis of Merit only. But the physics entrance was stripped-off in 2019 by college authorities, citing economic reasons, despite resistance against this decision by the physics faculty, after which, the Department of Physics also has to select students based on the board exam's merit only.The physics faculty is very nice, and have understanding professors, who try to help any student even in their personal problems. The environment of the college is also the best in Kolkata. This college is a site for cultural heritage. Freedom fighter, Shri Subhash Chandra Bose, spiritual monk Swami Vivekananda, ISKCON founder, Swami Prabhupada, all studied here, and the list goes on. Department of Physics also has two dedicated computer labs only for physics students, for computer programming, and two different laboratories for physics experiments. Everything about this college is good, but it seems that the college authorities do not release much-required funding on time. Apart from these, the college and the department separately take time to time anonymous feedback from the students, and I have noticed that they act accordingly on the feedback to improve the downsides. From this year, the physics department has started a bi-weekly career and entrance exam-oriented course for the students."

The faculties here are extremely qualified. That is one aspect there has been no compromise about and there are no two opinions about it. Thoroughly experienced faculties with dynamic teaching methods as well as a robust faculty review method keep the course improvements on the fly. We have reviews about their teaching methods for every section of the batch to suit every section accordingly and it is incorporated keeping the identity of students obscure.

Term exams were moderate, but since MBA is a residential course with enough pre-reads before every class and compulsory class participation, every student is thorough with the syllabi and the topics. So there is no cramming up before the exams but passing them isn't a breeze and sincere effort is reqired, albeit lower amplitude"

Basically it totally depends upon your needs and priorities when it comes to ""which club is the best"". My priority was to get into a techno management club, so I will just brief down the activities all the techno management clubs do.
From my experience, the Hackathon and Coding Club is the best. BIT Sindri is an old and prestigious institution. It has many clubs some of them are old too.

Madhav R,NIT Trichy,"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.1,The beautiful journey of my college life in NIT Trichy,"NIT Trichy is one of the best colleges in India for engineering. It performs way better than many IIT's and is at NIRF rank 9 in engineering for the past two years. I had cleared JEE Mains with AIR 10683 in the year 2020. Even though I gave my JEE Advance I couldn't get a mechanical engineering seat in top IIT's hence, I utilized my JEE Mains rank for joining NITT. Mechanical Engineering was in my mind and additionally due to home state quota I got the seat quite comfortably in the JOSAA counselling. While the pandemic affected all sectors, I feel many of my peers including myself lost interest in studying as exam dates were continuously delayed and extended. This was the reason I couldn't score enough in JEE Advance. I contacted a few seniors and various websites such as collegedunia.com and siksha.com for the reviews of NITT before JOSAA started. One of the most discussed thing on the internet was that sometimes few professors were not up to the mark. This made me think about my decision for sometime but I realized that self study is more important in college life. The alumni network of NITT is vast with some big names such as Mr. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Mr. K.R. Sridhar, Mr. Palanivel Thiagarajan, etc. Moreover, the club culture in NITT is exceptional where we get to learn and reciprocate granting us excellent exposure. I can assure the quality of clubs since I'm a part of a few clubs myself and it was very interesting even though things were online. While its undeniable that IIT's are in the top, NITT is not far behind, and its definitely worth it if you had to choose between course and college."

Student (Anonymous),Birsa Institute of Technology - [BIT] Sindri,"B.Tech, Information Technology",10.0,"Internships, visualise students in real world of industry.","The biggest advantage of choosing the information technology branch for a career is that it has a very low cost of education as compared to many other career choices. I choose that field because I love digital works like photo editing, web designing, making programs, graphics designing, that can help us make life easier. About my college education, it's fun and interesting because you are engaging digital works and many more. The faculties at bit Sindri for the information technology department are awesome. The way of teaching is very nice. The ratio of students and teaching professors is approximately 1:2.  All faculties are PhD holders from different IITs. The way of teaching is very nice.  Every month there should be a monthly quiz competition and other activities organised. In every semester there are two mid semester and teacher assessment test taken.
