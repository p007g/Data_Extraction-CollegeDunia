The average package is from 3.5LPA to 7LPA. and they get high packages based on their knowledge too. 
A maximum number of students are getting placed no matter what the package is.
As I'm from the core, the placements in Core companies are being done on the campus. We Civil and mechanical Engineers should find jobs in the core after leaving the campus.

Life at the campus is surely a unique experience. From waking up to the extreme colds at 15-17° in the morning, from walking back from dinner in that same temperature, it becomes warmer when the sun is shining, but that's the only time it's pleasant, however, depending on the perspective you can call it cold or pleasant.
There is an issue, which is, the college the hostel and our appointed canteen are all 15-20 mins walking away at least, which eventually becomes inconvenient every time to walk that far every time. Especially during lunchtimes and early breakfast to college times.
Availability of books is not limited exactly even though the libraries are smaller sorta, a shelf filled in the staffroom, regardless it's completed with all necessary needs."

The library is very good in NEW VIVA, with plenty of books to choose from your course and other fields that you are interested in.
You also get free wifi in the library with computer facilities and a stationary shop.
There is no special amenity in the classroom, it's just an old classroom with lights and fans and some crooked-up benches to sit on.
There are a lot of sports facilities in New viva college gymkhana.
There are a lot of extracurricular activities but sadly I was not a part of any of them.

They have an Instagram page."
Sai manaswini,Santhiram Engineering College Nandyal - [SREC],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",6.8,For me I had learnt a lot from my college.but What ever the college is student mentality matters.,"We will be given placement assistance from starting of the third year itself. Every topic which is required to attempt the company exams will be given training. Some external organizations will be coming to college for providing students with the training.
There will be only some on-campus drives. But no need to worry because these days large MNCs are recruiting students in bulk by conducting national-wide off-campus exams irrespective of their colleges. If we utilize the training provided by college it will be really helpful and easy to crack those exams.
I'm saying this confidently because I got placed in five different companies.
College TPO is very friendly. sometimes he'll be harsh to students if the situations and behavior of students are out of control.
In my batch i.e.,2018-22 batch 162 students got a place in just their 6th semester as of now. How cool it is. The last batch, it is a 60% conversion rate. But this time before completing the course I'm seeing that rate."

Every topic which is required to attempt the company exams will be given training. Some external organizations will be coming to college for providing students with the training.
There will be only some on-campus drives. But no need to worry because these days large MNCs are recruiting students in bulk by conducting national-wide off-campus exams irrespective of their colleges. If we utilize the training provided by college it will be really helpful and easy to crack those exams.
I'm saying this confidently because I got placed in five different companies.
College TPO is very friendly. sometimes he'll be harsh to students if the situations and behavior of students are out of control.
In my batch i.e.,2018-22 batch 162 students got a place in just their 6th semester as of now. How cool it is. The last batch, it is a 60% conversion rate. But this time before completing the course I'm seeing that rate."

There is some good faculty. Currently the Teachers: Student ratio is 2:35 approx.

Although the package is the highest for Tech placements. Having an ECE branch also allows you to give government engineering exams like PSU, GATE, etc.
The faculty is good not too much like that of IITs, NITs, IIITs but they are highly knowledgeable so if you really want to go on the research side then start following the professors in the beginning and they will help you for sure. Professors are very frank and friendly, to be honest.
There exists two major exams conducted per semester Mid Term and End Term. It's not difficult to pass the exams; you only need to devote some time (say 1week, 2week) before the commencement of exams giving you a lot of free time.
However, in online mode due to continuous evaluation, the schedule becomes so hectic."

Their teaching method is also quite awesome. Every year there are two semesters for two years. Each week an assignment was given to everyone to complete in time. I have chosen this course due to the fact I have to examine something new about machines and robotics and the scope of this department is extra in the future so I have chosen this course. Only one part of the AIML branch is right here and 60 - 70 students maximum. The faculty is very useful and pleasant here. I preferred that. The educating approach is so precise right here all the teachers train very nicely and are useful they focus on each student. Exams right here are very hard however if you find out about it."
Dipendra kanjilal,Brainware University,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Biotechnology",10.0,Brainware University is a very great institute.,"1. At this time biotechnology is a very useful course for us. There are so many options or job fields are available in this course.
2. The faculty members are very good. They are very polite to us. They always help us in every situation.
3. All the faculty members are well educated. They all have doctorate degrees in their subject. The technique which they are used to teach us, that's very impressive. If we faced any problem learning something or if we can't understand anything they teach us many times. And if we have any doubt about any topic they help us every time. 
4. There are a total of 3 years of courses, and 6 semesters are there. Every semester there are 2 class test exams of 20 marks. And for the main exam or semester exam, there are two parts one is theory and one is practical, each part carries 100 marks and you have to get at least 40 marks for qualifying. And the question pattern are good. If we study very well then we can easily be qualified. But you do not need to worry about the exam."

All the faculties in my university are very good they all are very helpful and supportive towards students some teachers are Ph.D. holders while some are gold medalists in their subjects but the teaching method is still old classroom-based theoretical approach and practical aspect of the subject is usually ignored and I think this is the department to improve.

Bilash Sen,Barasat Government College,"MA, Bengali",7.7,My review of Barasat Government College,"The fee does not increase very often. And it being a government college fee is very low compared to other colleges. Our admission fee was around Rs 5400. And for every semester the fee stays approximately 4000. Before every exam for admit card, the fee is between 600-1000. So the total fee in two years is under Rs 20000.

The scholarships are available for good students. SVMCM scholarship is available for both boys & girls. But a minimum of 60% marks in graduation is required and to renew this scholarship for the 2nd year you have to get more than 53% marks in the first two semesters. The scholarship amount is 24000 per year. For the girls Kanyashree scholarships are available. Those who got over 45% marks can avail themselves of these scholarships. For minority candidates, a small number of scholarships are available name OASIS"
Ashish Yadav,IMS Ghaziabad (University Courses Campus),"BBA, Retail Marketing",9.8,A Great Place for holistic development!!,"The fees for the first year are 120000 and for the second and third year is 128000. Even I don't know the reason behind the fee hike but yeah your money is worth spending here. You won't regrate spending money here. Industrial Visits, Workshops are free of cost here maybe that's why they are charging high in 2nd and 3rd year."
