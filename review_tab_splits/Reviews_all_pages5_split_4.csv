Faculty are also good 
The faculty-student ratio is the same

Bagala Gowtham Narasimha,Vignana Bharathi Institute of Technology - [VBIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.5,Review on VBIT,"I have chosen the course electronic and communication engineering because I can improve my brief knowledge of hardware and software. I have chosen the course for the government job. So, I can move for private or government jobs easily. The faculty, they are good experience in teaching the core subjects of electronics and different communications. The way of teaching faculty is extraordinary. But it is difficult to pass the subjects. We have to focus on the mathematical term, theory, expression etc"
Rishabh Nahriya,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Electrical Engineering",7.5,College was fine,I am in the electrical engineering branch at Netaji Subhas university of technology.

Shashwat kumar,United College of Engineering & Research - [UCER],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.0,Mera desh mera college,"According to me, the curriculum is good but it's a little bit longer to be covered in one semester. Although the faculty members are fully enthusiastic and are with the students. 
Faculty members are all gate qualified and many have already done PHD.
In the ECE department, there are 15 faculty members and over 50 students which I think is more than sufficient. 
Our curriculum is designed such that the students have to study thoroughly and so as the exams."
Varu Solanki,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Artificial Intelligence",6.0,Internship opportunities,"My course is computer science engineering and according to its placement I selected this course because I am interested too much in it main faculty and guest faculty both are there. Hod and top faculty are best in their qualification and also guest faculty are passed from IIT and have MTech and PhD. Course Fees: INR 210000 per year. Internship opportunities are available on campus but there is a thing for boys and girls both are different a girl can get internships easily but for a boy, it's too difficult to on campus you have to be petty good at coding and with a GPA of 9 +. So about the fee, I would like to say it's a bit costly as other govt colleges are much more cost-effective but this JAC Delhi college is not. college + hostel+mess for my course is 12-13 lakh for 4 years which is costly and for scholarships, there is one merit-based that is available for everyone."

Student (Anonymous),KLE Technological University,"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.2,The Elite,"I must say it is one of the best universities.
The reason to choose this course: E&C is one of the best branches because if you compare it with other branches some branches teach only about programming they don't have any hardware knowledge, and some branches teach only about hardware. But in e&c you will learn both programs as well as hardware.
In this college you will get one of the best faculties, best in the sense they too supportive and encourage you to do something great,
The faculty-student ratio may be for every 10 to 15 students one faculty is there.
Most of the faculties have the PhD degrees with a great experience.
After every 1 and a half months, there will be an exam i.e internals, there total of 2 internals and an end sem exam.
It is not too difficult to pass the exam but yes questions will be completely application based, but a student can pass easily."

SOHAN RAUL,Gandhi Institute for Technology - [GIFT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.0,"Must known facts before enrolling in GIFT, Bhubaneswar","Unlike other colleges, there are not any hidden charges. Fees hike is rare unless there is any inflation. Study cost is worth. Because what you get in your fees is completely worth it. 
You will find many scholarships like state and central government all scholarship is applicable to you. Including this, Industries like SAIL and some other releases their scholarship. You will get notified by the faculty members who are specially appointed to aware students about scholarship information. College claims that they will help you to get study loans but I recommend you to manage yourself for study loans if you need them.
Come to jobs, colleges provide campus joining where companies like TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, etc. recruit students. But my suggestion is, you always look for off-campus opportunities and don't worry about how to get to know about opportunities. You will automatically get to know if you have a strong friend zone."

In an online class, there is not much interest shown. The term exams take place every 45 days it is taken 2 times in a semester and other lab exams are also taken they are somewhat tough but easy to manage.

Better to read daily and answer all questions correctly."

And my package was at that time 3L per annum and now I am getting 5.8L Per annum so they provided it to a highly reputed company. When you completed the course you will get a call automatically from the company and they called you for an interview. The campus provides all student's details with their grades to the companies. So their placement is well maintained. I am in a batch of 40 students and my class 25 got the jobs within the month after completing the course.

In our semester there are mostly female teachers. Well qualified and experienced.  But in our section one or two teachers are underqualified according to be. Because they give us any kind of practical knowledge.
In a section, there are 32 students. The ratio is good.
There are two midterms in one semester and one final exam
Mid-term is easy just read the assignments u will crack ka exam with a good score."
Tanmay Agnihotri,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.2,Great,"So I got rank 78000. And in this rank mechanical seemed the best choice as I wasn't passionate about coding. After coming to college I came to know that mechanical is best in terms of placement infrastructure faculties. All faculties are Ph.D. from IITs. Labs are not that standard but management is working on improvement. 
There are two mid-semester and one end-semester exam each semester. The semester starts from December after covid till April ( 4 months).1st year exams are easy to pass but from 2nd-year the difficulty increases. Professors also don't give numbers in exams."

To those who can't afford this much fee, there is also a scholarship called CVSPK which is given to some specific students who full fills the required conditions or you can also avail of an education loan from SBI or UNION bank both banks have their branches in NSUT campus because of which it becomes easy for students to get a loan. If you are going to pay your college fee on a loan then must check the loan amount bracket  (up to which you can't give security ) by SBI ( only if you gonna take the loan from SBI ). 
Campus Jobs is good You can check the previous year's placement record."
KALADI ROSHITHA LAKSHMI,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Amritapuri Campus,"B.Tech, Electrical And Computer Engineering",6.4,Amrita Experience,"The main reason behind choosing this course is the interlink between computer science and the electrical department. Faculty is friendly which helps you to get more knowledge and also the classes are interactive which includes both smart classes and practical sessions.
As ours is the 2nd batch of this course in college we were so less in strength compared to other branches. 
Most of the faculties are Ph.D. scholars in the particular field.
There will be 1 mid-term examination and 1 Endsem including a Project which is of 65 internals and 35 Externals 
Pass or Fail depends on the student in my opinion it's not too easy to pass nor too tough to fail."

Aditya Narayan Singh,Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",9.8,NSUT in a nutshell,"i chose mechanical as my goal was always to be a civl servant and not a mnc puppy 
mechanical engineering was not my desired branch i wanted ece so badly but being a general candidate in this country is as tough as being a boy in a female parlour but never the less whatever happens its for the good
engineering me ratio bhi badhiya hai inka 1:5 i.e. one girl to 5 boys 
faculty and teachers of this college are highly qualified individuals and they are very polite in every aspect of teaching.
exams are mains mid sems and endsems along with 2 class tests held in every semester and as far as difficulty is concerned it always depends on the examinee and how much he/she had studied for it but as far as as i am concerned exams are mostly based on what the teachers are teaching during the class so if one is attentive in the class during lectures he/she will be good to score decent marks in exams."

The faculty-student ratio is 1:12, ensuring that everyone is able to grasp the concepts taught and clear their doubts. We have highly qualified faculty, with some who are stalwarts in their respective fields. Teaching methods vary according to faculty, but there is a central emphasis on case-based learning, which makes difficult concepts easier to relate to.  There is a lot of academic rigour at XIMB, and while actually failing a course is pretty rare - the academic load can get stressful at times."

Be it an institution, be it an office, or even a home. We must make those spaces as user-friendly and comfortable as we can. Three permanent faculty is about 15-20 and students intake 80 (so 40 students per section). The teachers are well qualified but still, the teaching methods lack somewhere. The term exams are often on time."

Also, ECE graduates can work in areas such as telecommunication, computer hardware and software development too.
Well, faculties are still being hired as the strength of the college is increasing. You can visit the website to know everything about the professor, their degree, their research programs, their published books etc.
Well, talking about years, then in the first year, it's difficult to score a good SGPA because the subjects are quite tough and you'll face some difficulties in them. In the second year, you can score an SGPA if you give some effort also."
Aakansh Atrey,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],"B.Tech, Oil Technology",8.3,A good education a good life,I chose this course coz this college provides great placements for chemical technology. The course curriculum is not so updated but it is satisfying as it offers a wide carrier scope for the future. The faculty-student ratio is quite good. Most faculties are PhD holders from Iits and some are from reputed institutes in India. There are two mid-semester and one end-semester examination that happen in the interval of one month each. First-year exams are easy to pass but from next year difficulty increases in terms of hard checking as well as questions.
