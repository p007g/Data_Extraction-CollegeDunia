and if you prepare by yourself I mean you have to prepare yourself for placements if you want a good placement. If you rely on college for everything then you will get disappointed, you will get placed but not on a higher package. There are so many companies that are big MNCs like TCS, Capgemini, etc are gonna come and recruit so many students so you don't have to worry about your job if you have at least an average score in all of your semesters. To sit in the placements you have to maintain a 7.5 cgpa every semester. The college supports you if have an idea and you want to do any startups you can take guidance from the faculty and seniors. The highest package of OCT is 6 to 7 links per annum."

Rishabh Singh,IEC Group of Institutions,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.4/10,Review of an Independent Engineer,"I chose this course as I always wanted to be an Engineer. And had a keen interest in programming languages. It always fascinated me that we can write code and make the computer work the way we desire. This has endless possibilities for application. 
Since I am from the CSE department. I would say in the Batch 2015-19 around 180 student were there divided into 4 sub sections. As It would not be possible to manage the number at once. So for each subject there are dedicated faculties which belongs to the department but there are certain subjects which were common to other department so other department teachers also used to teach CSE students. 
Most of the teachers had qualifications as Master of their subjects.
Tech qualified. Only a few of the teachers were Ph.D. qualified. The teaching method of the First & second-year faculties was very good. They focus on leaning of students but in the third and fourth years teaching faculties don't pay that much attention to the student. Students have to rely mostly on self-studies."

People out there think it's an awesome college by seeing the tag government in it. But the scenario is a little different many departments' teachers were not permanent. They were on a contract basis. So the problem which lies here is students can't ask doubts (if any) later since we are not familiar with the new teacher. Not all but some of the teachers who are on a contract basis teach very casually which affects the semester exams."

Poonam pradhan,Biju Patnaik Institute of Information Technology and Management Studies - [BIITM],"Integrated MBA, General",10.0/10,Best part for learning,"The fee for 2 years for MBA was like 3.6 lakhs. I know the fee structure in this college is a bit high. The Biju Patnaik Institute of Information Technology and Management Studies fee structure for an MBA was high but there were many students who could really pay the fee easily. The fee could be even paid in instalments but on the stipulated dates and I think late fees would fetch a little fine. The hostels are also kind of affordable which the college provides affordable cost. The hostel fees in BIITM are 22,000 rupees for non-Ac rooms and 34,000 for AC rooms."

Nisha Wankhade,Delhi University - [DU],"BA {Hons.}, Political Science",4.7/10,Life at correspondence campus,"My life on campus wasn't as good as I had thought because it was monotonous. College life is all about making friends, having fun, fest and so on but I didn't get anything for myself it was more pathetic than my school life. Lastly a first was conducted by campus it was the 110 anniversary of Delhi University in which students were not invited. In the name of extracurricular activities, no facilities have been provided no sports not anything else. There is a social group which was run by students to ensure their interest within campus named @dusolstudentunion  it is similar to ABVP which protests on the behalf of every student who all are suffering from their pathetic rules and regulations."
