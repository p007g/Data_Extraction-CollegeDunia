So the students don't need to worry that much.
The students become eligible to get placements after getting into the 4th year to be precise when they reach 7th semester. So after sitting in couples of interview rounds when the candidate crack the round he/she gets selected by the company for their job offerings and aftr the course completion you can easily join the office.
The highest package offered as of now is around 9.7lakh pa. And the average packages offered varies between 3.5-5lakh pa. So that's a decent pay scale according to me.

Rohit kalwane,Yash Institute of Pharmacy,"B.Pharma,",8.0/10,The best pharmacy college in Aurangabad,"When you go away to college for the first time, you want to make sure you're prepared. You may be living on your own for the first time, so there could be some items you wouldn't normally consider taking because someone at home, such as a parent or guardian, usually takes care of them for you.  Consult your college acceptance literature for any specific items your college asks you to bring. If you're able, touch base with your roommate prior to school to make sure you're not bringing duplicates of large items such as TVs, couches or refrigerators. Having double will just take up space and make for a less comfortable environment.
There are much more books are available in the library related to course and also not related to course.
The various sports and extra curriculum activities are taken by the college like cricket holly ball badminton.and in extra curriculum activities they appriciat singing dancing speeches . Essays.

In terms of Sport, it is well maintained. The only option you get, to showcase your talent is through worship and only that is valued there. The management does not provide a secular atmosphere, especially for the number of fees we are asked to pay which is definitely ridiculous and not worth it. Even our farewell was another worship which was disappointing to most of the people. Since there isn't a permanent classroom as per the system you usually don't get the choice of emotionally bonding with your classmates. You can only pretend that since you are paying a lot."

Student (Anonymous),Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences - [Karunya Deemed University],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",4.4/10,A honest review about Karunya University,"The college is all about worship 24x7. The management believes that the talent had been gifted to you and the favour should be returned through worshipping 24x7. The number of fees that you are paying, the inter/intracultural events and extracurricular activities are expected to be there but the management would allow it only if it is conducted in a spiritual manner. In terms of Sport, it is well maintained. The only option you get, to showcase your talent is through worship and only that is valued there. The management does not provide a secular atmosphere, especially for the number of fees we are asked to pay which is definitely ridiculous and not worth it. Even our farewell was another worship which was disappointing to most of the people. Since there isn't a permanent classroom as per the system you usually don't get the choice of emotionally bonding with your classmates. You can only pretend that since you are paying a lot."

Vansh Chugh,Arya College of Engineering,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",5.0/10,Top Engineering college in Jaipur.,"Internship opportunities are average. Not many companies come for internships in college. Also, the skill gap is very high so some students don't get to do internships as they are not that skilled and not updated with the latest Tech Skills due to the curriculum of college not being that good. The stipend provided is between 10000- 25000 per month. 90% of the internships are paid.
It is necessary for every student to do an internship during the third year or do some real-life projects.
I am in 1st year so I have not done an internship yet and the review I wrote is based on the experiences of my seniors."
