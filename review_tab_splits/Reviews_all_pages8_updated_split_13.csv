Akashdeep singh,Sri Guru Nanak Dev Khalsa College - [SGNDKC],"BA, General",7.6/10,Great college but lacks infrastructure.,I chose this course because I have a keen interest in economics. And also my 12th percentage is matching with the cut-off of this course. The faculty ratio is also too good it is like 1:15/16 which is nice according to me. Teachers are well qualified and they solve our doubts. As of now due to covid online classes is going on so there is no physical contact between students and teachers still we didn't feel anything wrong as the teaching methods of teachers are good and they put too much effort into solving our doubts. There is a semester system so every 6 months there are semester exams. They are of moderate difficulty but if you fail in any subject then you have to reappear in that subject during the next semester. Total 6 semesters are there in my course and the course duration is of 3 years.
RAHUL PRASAD,Brainware University,"BCA, General",8.6/10,Genuine review from 1st year student,"The course that I choose is what I have an interest in, Programming languages. The faculty members of our university are highly qualified (doctorate or master's level in their respective fields) and ready to help us in all difficulties we face during the university working hours. The faculty-student ratio is 1:60.
The teaching method of our teachers is very good in the way they teach us slowly and with 100% detail and allow every student to ask their doubt in the class itself.
The term exams are conducted semester wise and two class tests in each semester. If a student follows all the lectures and revises them regularly he or she will pass the exams without facing any difficulty."
