Faculty to student ratio is good here, not the best but I will say it's good. In every department, we have plenty of teachers.
The quality of the faculties is good, which I thought before entering this college. Because most of the teachers are from NITs and IITs, one thing you must know is that teachers should not be judged by their qualifications they should be judged by their teachings, like see a bike mechanic is much more perfect than a recently passed-out engineer because the bike mechanic has the experience.
Every month there is an exam and honestly, it's hard to get good marks."

Parth Sethi,Chitkara University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",7.8,Why to enroll for Computer science at Chitkara university,"I choose this course because I liked it and also I have planned for this course long before joining the university. Also, the faculty is pretty good that always tries to make things normal and easy for the students. the faculty-student ratio is somehow high here as the course is opted by a lot of students but it quite manages out without any certain or problematic situation. The faculty is pretty experienced and very good at its job . I guess almost every student quite like the way they are teaching. Exams are held regularly, for times I thought every week has an exam. University takes 20-30 exams every semester excluding practicals, viva, etc. the difficulty levels vary from exam to exam for example- End term exams are more difficult than monthly-based exams, etc but overall if you are studying regularly it's quite easy to pass all subjects. Extra classes or doubt sessions are also held after the completion of the syllabus to ensure students get the proper knowledge to score higher."

Placement cell is active in the college as it provides various internships and placements of different sectors to the students studying in any year. Virtual, part time or full time internships and jobs are there. Full time is generally do-able in the months of May and June(in semester break). Mainly jobs are from private or corporate sector. One should take care of the attendance criteria also before applying to the internship in which they are wishing to join. University or college won't entertain any such thing. Internship policy covering every aspect is provided by the college. Students in humanities courses have relatively more chances of getting job opportunities in comparison to commerce and science stream."

I have been very lucky to be exposed to professors who have been a delight to study under. The professors are industry professionals from companies like HSBC, Zydus, Standard Chartered, HUL . 
Most of our professors are PhDs and those who aren't are from the Industry. 
There are 6 terms. It is not hard to pass but needs a lot of hard work. I got more than 9 GPA in the 1st term but I had to pull all-nighters. It depends on the person and what they prioritize. People who are very active in their clubs also get great jobs and can get better packages than high rankers. It all depends on how we carry ourselves and how much we wish to learn. IMT helps you grow as an Individual."

The scholarship is only applicable to those students who took admitted from counselling and 75%+ attendance is required and some more perspective is applicable. There's a Finance department if anyone has any type of issue or query about loans, payments, fees, etc.

Student (Anonymous),"Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT Bombay - [SJMSOM]","MBA, General",8.3,SJMSOM-complete insights of the Bschool,"I had work experience in supply chain and wanted to pursue my career in the operations domain. SJMSOM is known best for its operations. For operations, they have highly experienced faculty. For other subjects as well faculty are highly qualified with master's, and Ph.D. from foreign universities. The student-to-faculty ratio is approximately 10:2, Teaching methodology varies from prof to prof but mostly all faculty follow case-based teaching, putting us into the shoes of managers and making us learn to think like a manager through different cases and examples.
In one semester there are two terms, each term has one midterm and one end sem examination. Apart from this regular presentations and assignments. But still, the curriculum is not very hectic, we can manage to have spare time left after classes and assignments and it's not very difficult to pass the examinations."
