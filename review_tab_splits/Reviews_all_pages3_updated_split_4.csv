Since our 2022 batch started late due to Covid our first year was compressed from being of 12 months to 8 months. So in my first year exams were conducted every alternate month to pace up with the speed of other year batches. exams were not that difficult to pass. if you are an average student you can easily score up to 7.5 CGPA."

Student (Anonymous),Indian Institute of Management - [IIMC],"MBA, General",8.6,A comprehensive look at IIM Calcutta,"MBA is the flagship program offered by IIM Calcutta and arguably what it is best known for. Some salient details regarding the program are:
Lasts two years with each year consisting of three trimesters (terms).
First-year follows a fixed curriculum consisting of 48 credits spread over three terms and 1 credit roughly equating to 10 hours of class time.
The second year allows for experimentation and is composed entirely of electives chosen by students.
Students are organized into 6 sections in their first year and each section usually has a designated professor for each course i.e. the student-to-teacher ratio is roughly 80-to-1 which remains largely the same even in year 2.
Professors are excellent and have a lot of leeway in choosing their teaching tools/pedagogy but case-based study is commonly the most prevalent
Grading is always relative although professors are able to choose the curve to a limited extent. Failing is almost never a concern but excelling is difficult."

Khushi Aggarwal,Delhi Technological University - [DTU],"MA, Economics",7.6,"Unheard and Unbiased Review -  USME, DTU","I chose to pursue a Master's in economics since I pursued it in Graduation and I have a keen interest towards the subjects. 
If you are someone with strong analytical skills and a quantitative approach along with an interest in economics, then you should go for a Master's. Also, you get eligible to apply for many economics-oriented government jobs, such as Indian Economic Services(IES), and RBI DEPR after pursuing Masters in Economics. The course here at DTU is designed in a very organised way. In 1st year, we are taught core subjects such as Micro, Macro, Maths and Econometrics. In 2nd year, there are theoretical subjects such as Indian Economics, Development, etc and you are supposed to do a dissertation. 
The faculty is pretty good. Since this is our first batch, so we have professors who are pursuing PHD from DSE, JNU and many prestigious universities in the field of economics and some are the ones who have already a good amount of teaching experience in the subjects taught."
