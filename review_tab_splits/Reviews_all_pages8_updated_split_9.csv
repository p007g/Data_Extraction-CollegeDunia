Student (Anonymous),King George's Medical University - [KGMU],"MBBS,",9.4/10,KGMU is not a college it's my home,"The teaching faculty was very good.Because the course is vast and no of subjects many so all course was divided into 3 professional exams.1st had 3 subjects,2nd had 5 subjects and last year had 11 subjects.But the schedule was such that every subject was covered and explained well. 
Lecturers in my college maybe 500 or more with average age of around 45. They have qualification of MD/MS or above. Senirmost heads the respective departments. Everyone has their own expertise in which they take lectures and help us understand the subject."

This course gives deep insight into the structure of medicines. I like medicines and the science involved in making them that's why I choose this course. It is the best course for students aspiring to be pharmacists. The faculty at sultan ul Uloom is well experienced and have good qualification skills. They are very friendly with students and help clear doubts anytime. the faculty-student ratio at our college is 1:4. Lecturers focus more on practical learning rather than textbook learning which is very good. Every semester 2 midterms are conducted which are somewhat hard to pass.

Ishani Kundu,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Aerospace Engineering",7.8/10,Enjoy you college life mindfully,The course fee is kind of high for Aerospace Engineering but you can obviously get a scholarship based on the percentage you scored on your 12th but incase you haven't scored good no need to worry you can attempt the LPUNest exam and score well in that and the scholarship will be then based on your score in LPUNest exam. Plus if you have any financial unstability you have an oppurtunity to get more scholarship as well. Also there is an oppurtunity to work part in the library after the college hours inside the campus.

At the time of admission 1lakh rupees are submitted as the college fee for the whole year. Besides this there was 12000 hostel fee, 5600 for co-curricular activities and separate mess fee. The students getting the benefit of scholarship don't have to pay college fee, but the other amounts are to ge given. The scholarship is mostly reservation based but there is a medhavi chhatra yojana in our state which allows poor but talented students, who got more than 85% in their boards to study free of cost in any college of M.P. but I couldn't get this benefit because our annual household income was a bit greater than their margins. Anyways, the students getting these benefits have to do an extra year of scholarship. The bonds are filed at the time of admission for rural service and if it's taken back then the penalty amount needs to be paid. But it is quiet low as compared to that of a private medical college, which charges around 10 lakh peryear"
