Monika S,M.O.P. Vaishnav College for Women,"BA, Journalism",9.0,Why one must choose M.O.P for Journalism degree,It is a well know fact that M.O.P is one of the reputable colleges in Chennai and it offers the best quality education. I chose this course since the college provides the best class curriculum and exposure. Journalism in MOP is always popular in and around Chennai. The college provides an exclusive course curriculum focusing mainly on real world scenarios. The college provides well trained and educated faculties. The Head of the Journalism Department is a Doctorate and other faculties also are two plus degree holders with exemptional training skills. The strength of each class is around 70. And the number of teachers for the Journalism Department is around 6. though the number of faculties is less in number the quality of education is not compromised. The teaching methods are very interactive and classes are mostly thought with presentations and case studies. The Internals and main exams are conducted as per the schedule and the exam corrections will be strict and not lenient.

And the best thing about civil engineering is that you can literally see every single thing/ construction going around you and relate it to your knowledge. 
The faculty-student ratio is pretty good, not only in my branch, rather in every branch of engineering, and if the college sees any differences in that ratio it always tries to recruit new professionals to teach. 
Qualification of teachers are pretty good because almost every teacher have a
master's degree some even have double masters or PhDs. I won't say that every teacher's method of teaching was excellent because I think that every person has a different understanding level and different way of teaching.
Final exams are quite difficult and you really have to study well for that otherwise you'll definitely fail."
Ritik,Poornima Institute of Engineering  and Technology - [PIET],"B.Tech, Computer Engineering",8.0,Poornima institute of engineering and technology,Faculty members are very cooperative you can easily talk to your teachers about your dought.

Monika S,M.O.P. Vaishnav College for Women,"BA, Journalism",9.0,Why one must choose M.O.P for Journalism degree,It is a well know fact that M.O.P is one of the reputable colleges in Chennai and it offers the best quality education. I chose this course since the college provides the best class curriculum and exposure. Journalism in MOP is always popular in and around Chennai. The college provides an exclusive course curriculum focusing mainly on real world scenarios. The college provides well trained and educated faculties. The Head of the Journalism Department is a Doctorate and other faculties also are two plus degree holders with exemptional training skills. The strength of each class is around 70. And the number of teachers for the Journalism Department is around 6. though the number of faculties is less in number the quality of education is not compromised. The teaching methods are very interactive and classes are mostly thought with presentations and case studies. The Internals and main exams are conducted as per the schedule and the exam corrections will be strict and not lenient.

The new campus is spread in 50 acres of land which has hostels, separate buildings for different departments, a large auditorium, indoor games building, etc. Right now, academic activities are going on the old campus which has two 6 storey buildings.

Classrooms are well cleaned and ventilated and wifi facility."
Rishika Rawat,Inderprastha Engineering College - [IPEC],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",7.0,Ipec Insight,"I chose this course because it gives me an overview of how things are really going on and what basis and criteria a structure are designed so that it remains safe throughout its lifespan. And the best thing about civil engineering is that you can literally see every single thing/ construction going around you and relate it to your knowledge. 
The faculty-student ratio is pretty good, not only in my branch, rather in every branch of engineering, and if the college sees any differences in that ratio it always tries to recruit new professionals to teach. 
Qualification of teachers are pretty good because almost every teacher have a
master's degree some even have double masters or PhDs. I won't say that every teacher's method of teaching was excellent because I think that every person has a different understanding level and different way of teaching.
Final exams are quite difficult and you really have to study well for that otherwise you'll definitely fail."

That sessional and pre-university test is very helpful for our university exam. The time of the exam is 3 hours. That is sufficient for attempting all questions in the exam. In our exam there are three sections short type, long type and options are also given in long type questions so we have relief there.

They have their own websites and Instagram handles too."
