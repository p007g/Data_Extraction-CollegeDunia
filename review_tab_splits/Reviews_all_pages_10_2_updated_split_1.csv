Sasmit Sitaram Kolhe,IIT Kharagpur - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITKGP],"B.Tech, Metallurgical And Materials Engineering",8.3,Pandemic review,"Because This was the course which I love to study and also I was suitable for my rank.
faculty:student ratio=1:19
They are highly qualified almost all had done Ph.D.'s.
The teaching method is dependent on each teacher and most teachers doesn't get a chance to share their knowledge in great detail because of Less TIme but If you ask them questions or doubts outside class hours they will definitely give you much more knowledge.
There are total 4 major exams in one year and If you want to just pass it maybe say around 6-8 pointers then you can just study for 10 days but If you want above that then you have to regularly attend lectures (to just get overall idea and concept of topic) and study regularly to get 8 above pointer.But the curriculum is designed in such a way that you have to study whether there are exams or not."

There's no strict ratio for the whole college, it depends from department to department. In some departments, it's really good and some departments are really bad. But overall speaking it's pretty decent like you won't face any difficulty only because of the ratio.

Like always, some faculties are really dedicated towards their profession and others just want to enjoy their salaries. But since the govt. introduced TEQUIP, maximum of faculties re young blooded and passionate to teach. So if someone wants to study he'll enjoy studying here.

EXAMS, that's where our college lags behind. We have no academic calendar (because of some internal political matters) and due to which exams always get delayed a little. But they're not that tough so you're not worried so much about the exams."

Nisha,IIT Guwahati - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITG],"B.Tech, Chemical Engineering",9.3,College Review of IIT Guwahati,"The fee is a bit high but it's fair according to other private colleges in the race and it's totally worth paying this fee here. The total fee per semester including mess and hostel charges comes around INR 1,35,000 so for 8 semesters means complete 4-year course becomes INR 10,80,000 and you can add few other expenses also. Banks easily provide education loans for IITs and many students opt for that. Out of the total fee, INR 1,00,000 is the tution fee which, SC/ST/PWD students need not pay. Also if a student's parent's annual income is less than 1lacs, he/she also need not pay tution fee and if parent's annual income is between 1lacs to 5lacs then the student has to pay only 1/3 of the tution fee. Hostel mess charges are the same for everyone. Also, there are other schemes like SC/ST/PWD students get a laptop from the college's side, they only need to pay 10% of the actual price."

Placement activities start from the third semester in the month of August. Students are trained to make professional video CVs and good CVs for interviews. Mock group discussions and interviews are conducted. Placement packages start from 3lacs to 9 lacs as per my knowledge. Well-established companies, MNC, start up on state and national level come for hiring students with good packages and promise to give good work experience. 
90+ percent of students get placed every year. Even during lockdown placement went smoothly and 95+ percent of students were placed in batch 2019-2021.

I am planning to get a good job with good package. Targeting FMCG company with marketing domain. Work for a few year and side by side try for job abroad. 

Can't rate the placement experience as it is yet to start but I can say it will be a good learning and memorable experience."

This is the best you can get in subjects. And as a perk due to autonomous status, you also have customized subjects that are more important and also revised every two years according to the trend going on. So your graduation will have the latest knowledge. And when coming to teaching experiences almost all the teachers are either p.hd or m.tech graduates.

ROHITH KUMAR SARAGADAM,Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology & Sciences - [ANITS],"B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering",8.5,A-Z about ANITS using A-Z,"Good aspects: 1.Discipline and punctuality of faculty(not students). 2.Some of the faculty are sound at their subjects.3. Almost every lab is available with all equipments. 4.Library is the best part of college for me. 5.Faculty and college Pretend to be very strict so that students will not be out of control. 6.Wearing uniform will bring you a lot of character as compared to non-uniform. 7.Well maintained Atmosphere.8. Very easy to pass the semester exams even scoring scoring high grades is also not a difficult thing though it is affiliated to AU that never impact anything as it is autonomous college.9. If you would like to enjoy of course you can(Theatres, Beach were nearby)10. Travelling for less than 1hour will get you down at vizag were you can find everything (Coaching centres, theatres, beaches etc)11. Workshops, clubs will be always available at your fingertips if your interested.12. Small Canteen but food is always available and that place would be as a good memory.Bad aspects: 1. You can feel the good Atmosphere but not royality as people find royality by the land occupied by the overall colleg here the college space is very less. 2. Only few faculties were sound at subject, I won't say other faculty are dumb they were just ok to teach you for semester examinations not more than that.3. Examination papers were of easy level everytime and paper correction also of same easy level.4. As I said level of teaching can be useful only upto semester exams so I should not even like to talk about practical way of teachingGVP-High fee and remaining pros and cons won't differ much between GVP and ANITS I think.MVGR-Difficult to travel to vizag for coachingSo I prefered ANITS over these three U can go through the college website ANITS.edu.in"
