Pooja Malik,"University Institute of Legal Studies, Panjab University","BALLB {Hons.},",6.8,"University Institute of Legal Studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh.","I chose for law i.e., B.A.LL.B. (Hons.) 5 Years Integrated Course in Panjab University. This department is named as University Institute of Legal Studies (UILS) at Panjab University. The faculty members are super friendly, especially with the newcomers. They try to resolve every issue faced by students at their level. The average teacher student ratio is 1:60 as there are 360 seats for candidates applying for B.A.LL.B. (Hons.) and they are divided into two main streams, separate for Arts and Commerce students, then again got divided into sections. The medium of teaching is English. 
The term exams are held after every 5-6 months of period and are really not that hard but you have to struggle for good markings, obviously."

They are professors, associative professors, assistant professors. Our faculty has PG qualifications with a doctorate. We have two semesters in a year. Each semester is of 6 months. We want to pay 2000 for the semester examination per year. In that particular semester, we have two mid examinations. In my point of view, it's easy to pass but it's difficult to gain more percentage. In each subject paper, we have 5 sections. Each section is a value of 12 marks. Mid examination a worth of 40 marks and semester examination is worth 60 marks"
Drishti Negi,Trinity Institute of Professional Studies - [TIPS],"BBA, General",5.8,College atmosphere is nice but it is not a money worth institute.,"I choose my course because of my interest in the management field and my prior study background.  Some teachers are very kind to all the students and also teach very well and some teachers attend classes just for teaching and not making classes communicative and interesting.  There is a total of 120 students in my shift studying BBA. Among these near 50 are girls and remaining are boys. All the teachers are well qualified and some teachers know the teaching methods very well. They prepare ppts for us which contain notes that are very detailed and short at the same time. The college conducts two exams in a semester one is internal and the other is external. Exams are conducted in every three months gap. The difficulty of the exam always depends upon the teacher but yes, not that hard."

Student (Anonymous),NIT Warangal,,1.8,"Review- [NIT], Warangal","1. I chose this course to learn Business skills and get placed in an MNC company.

4. But the main problem for the students is: The system of ""Anonymous grading"" or ""Blind Grading"" is not followed by NITW. ""blind grading"" means masking or hiding a student`s name/roll number when correcting answer paper, done to prevent bias while correcting of answer paper by the faculty. This ""Blind grading"" system is practiced by many Central, Private, State universities, B Schools in India and even International Universities. But this practice is not followed in the School of Management, as a result, there is partiality incorrect answer papers and grading.

It's good if you want to just want to add it to your resume but, if you really want to go for an Internship(and not just the usual boring classroom lectures) or want to get a feel of how actually things are done in the real world, then, I would suggest you to go apply to various such firms(HP, HCL, Tata Technologies, etc.) when they are ready to intake for the internships.
You can also try for an opportunity with one of your own dream companies so that you get to know what you will be signing for(if you get placed in that company)."

Student (Anonymous),Purulia Polytechnic,"Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",8.0,PURULIA POLYTECHNIC  COLLEGE REVIEW,"I think at a polytechnic level, presuming that your internship will most likely be related to your field of study, then it doesn't matter where you intern but what you can get out of the company in terms of knowledge, and depending on your goal.
For eg if you plan to be an entrepreneur, and you go to an innovative company, you can learn about the new and interesting methods that other companies have yet to adopt, which gives you an edge. If it is to a traditional firm, then find out where you can value add to improve the processes. In the past, it might not be easy to change old ways of doing things but you have the adVantage of technology today. I think this is a good place to start because many companies in SG are in need of an overhaul"

The students to teacher ratio are 1:8. Due to the rare group, the masters completed teachers are very less and that earn more in the fieldwork thank the teaching field. So everyone opts for fieldwork so very few people who are passionate about the teaching they only still here in the instructions. The semester timing was around 6 months hardly. And the syllabus was very tough and the problematic part was very tough.

Therefore, it takes profound skill to juggle both academics and social life. Usually, on the weekends, we get together and cook dinner because eating out in the city is expensive. We make a lot of extra food so we all have leftovers throughout the week. Other regular activities we do together include going to concerts, plays, and poetry readings.

KCCILHE has really been trying hard even at the time of pandemic to provide their students with as much as exposure they can. there are many events organized by the college like webinars, competitions, societies and much more. The students here are also good, they have a motivation to do things and the zeal to learn more. There are around 75 students in my batch. The teachers here are young and interactive so it becomes easy to have a conversation regarding many topics other than studies as well. The only problem I found was that faculties change every semester some teachers are constant but some are here for 1 semester only. The exams were really good and I secured 1st rank in the 1 semester. so, I know that exams were good and upto the mark. If you study only in the classes and revise at the time of exams, It would be enough. So you have time for other extracurricular activities."

There is no doubt that expenses are increasing and fees paid by the students is the source of income from the law schools like nujs which take pride  in its financial independence.
However, aanyone familiar with the law school sceneries will be able to tell you that some very important thing have been overlooked.

Prarthana Chakraborty,Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College - [BRSNC],,5.3,A brief review of my college campus,"Firstly, the college is really near to my house so I really don't have to worry about extra rental cost and the transportation cost is also minimum. Secondly, as I am traveling less that means I will be less tired and can contribute more time in my studies or extra curricular activities that I am interested in . The third reason is the cost at which the course is been provided is really amazing .As it's an professional course you will get your graduation degree after completing your 3 years. Admission process is really simple you have to enroll yourself through their official site that is brsnc . After you got selected you have to provide your marksheet for verification and you have to go through registration procedure. Reason for preferring this college over other is the total fees that you have to pay for three years , I mean you will save a lot of money if you compare the course fees of this college and course fees of any other college."
