Ankush Goyal,IMT Ghaziabad,"PGDM, Marketing",8.3,A read for the right decision for your career!,"I have chosen marketing as specialization and as a degree, it is a core MBA profile. The field should be chosen exclusively based on one's interests and future opportunities. The person's career and educational background influences the chosen specialization. 
IMTG has a faculty: student ratio of about 1:40which is good in the industry with professors and experts in their fields. 
The teachers are all Ph.D. holders. The method is a case study based which helps students learn from real-life scenarios along with practical importance given to roleplay and regular assignments. 
Term exams are once in 3 months with regular assignments and PPT. One gets thorough knowledge about the subject from reading and practically applying the skill. Difficulty depends on the preparation of the student and it's easy to score in exams but the marking is relative."

Student (Anonymous),Indian Institute of Management - [IIM],"PGPM, Human Resources",7.1,Seeing IIM Indore through the eyes of an HR student,"The total fee for PGP-HRM is around 18.3L for two years. It includes tuition fees, hostel fees, a mess deposit for 1st year, caution money, and medical insurance premiums. During 2nd-year participants get a chance to opt out of the mess. The average placement salary is around 20L, so a participant can easily return his loan back in 5-6 years with 30k-40k EMI.  The course is not very expensive if compared to the PGP batch of IIM Indore. Top participants even get an average salary package of around 36lacks which is almost the same for PGP thus it becomes easy for them to pay back the loan amount because of the less fee structure compared to PGP.

Student (Anonymous),Indian Institute of Management - [IIM],"PGPM, Human Resources",7.1,Seeing IIM Indore through the eyes of an HR student,"The total fee for PGP-HRM is around 18.3L for two years. It includes tuition fees, hostel fees, a mess deposit for 1st year, caution money, and medical insurance premiums. During 2nd-year participants get a chance to opt out of the mess. The average placement salary is around 20L, so a participant can easily return his loan back in 5-6 years with 30k-40k EMI.  The course is not very expensive if compared to the PGP batch of IIM Indore. Top participants even get an average salary package of around 36lacks which is almost the same for PGP thus it becomes easy for them to pay back the loan amount because of the less fee structure compared to PGP.

My experience was satisfactory. 50% of the faculty is amazing, no doubt. They are renowned professors with exceptional knowledge and are very helpful. But the rest 50% are just average and below average, either they don't have enough teaching experience and fail to teach in class or their subject knowledge is not very up to the mark.

Our subject books are available in the local market and on e-commerce sites like Flipkart and Amazon. Some of the students buy books from seniors at a cheaper price. Our library is not maintained well so, usually, students don't go there too much.
Some sports are being played in the college like cricket, volleyball and badminton. But no sports tournament or competition is organised ever in the college.
No social groups, clubs or websites are run by the students. They are just studying in college and are not doing any extra activities rather than studying."

Prince kumar,Aligarh College of Engineering and Management - [ACEM],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.0,Honest review in my college.,"We celebrated the annual day in the first week of December and the freshers' party in the month of November. Accept these two fests no fests were celebrated in the college. But the teachers told us that from next semester every fest will be organised.
Our subject books are available in the local market and on e-commerce sites like Flipkart and Amazon. Some of the students buy books from seniors at a cheaper price. Our library is not maintained well so, usually, students don't go there too much.
Some sports are being played in the college like cricket, volleyball and badminton. But no sports tournament or competition is organised ever in the college.
No social groups, clubs or websites are run by the students. They are just studying in college and are not doing any extra activities rather than studying."
