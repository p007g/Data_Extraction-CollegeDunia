Yash,Jagannath International Management School - [JIMS] Vasant Kunj,"BCA, General",8.0,"Good College- [JIMS] Vasant Kunj, New Delhi","There are various annual fests at the University organised also the college organizes some of the annual best like in BCA BBA and BJMC.
Since I am a student of BCA I know about the synet fest.
The classrooms are fully air-conditioned.
Also, the library is there so that students can issue the books.
But the campus has no ground so sports activities are not possible."
Sachin Kumar Daga,Government Engineering College - [ECB],"B.Tech, Information Technology",4.6,"The Truth- [ECB], Bikaner","There is one fest which is organized by Mechanical Department ""ABHIDUYA"". it was totally organized by Mechanical Department. The contribution is given by Every branch. It was held in the month of March Last or April Starting. There are a lot of books in Library and Journals but as to point of view of Studies, there are not so many updated Books. Sports are there every tear our College teams attend the DTU sports festival and Cricket, Basketball, Badminton team participate in this also.
Some social groups are there like for Photography, Software, SAC and many more but some are not registered but they working in the background and handle all activites which is Possible."
Pk,Payyannur College Payyanur,"BA, Economics",8.0,The ever green payyanur college,"After plus two examinations I chose economics as my core subject, coming to know about the future scope of the subject. The economics department is one of the most active ones in the college with three faculty members, each of them qualified with good teaching skills and subject proficiency. The total seats for the course are 60 and in most years it gets completely filled. Teachers usually or most predominantly use the lecture methods in the classroom. However often some seminars and debates are organized for the students as well. Here university follows credit-based semester program, where examinations are conducted timely and results are published much faster than any other university in Kerala. One who is serious in his studies may not find it difficult to pass in the subject. It is not that tough at all. Securing above 70%marks in semester examinations is not that difficult task."
Yash rathore,Amity University,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",10.0,The story of Amity,I chose computer science because I like computers from my childhood and I have my interest in this field that's why I chose this field and another point is that computer science is in very high demand these days every computer science engineer is very likely to get a job in any multinational company the faculty of this college is very excellent I liked the faculty very much the faculty is well much qualified and there is a solid experience in teaching. There are cameras in classes projectors screens too much. The term exams happen every half year and every 1 month. And the level of the exam is not difficult but can say it is moderate. Anyone can easily get past if he studies well.
Nikhil Srivastav,NIT Warangal,,7.1,MSc at technical institute.,"Nitw is among the top nits, the faculty members are excellent.It provides a get good exposure since all other non tech and tech (BTech Mtech ) branches students live together (hostel) and actively participate in all type of events.But if you are looking forward for higher studies (qualifying CSIR UGC NET GATE ICMR ) then you have to extract your time of own being a tech institute you are directly or indirectly endulge in lots of activities."

Student (Anonymous),L.J.D. law College,"BA +  L.L.B,",6.8,Brief Overview,"There are two campuses- Tollygunge and Falta. I have attended both these campuses so I would like to explain them separately. FALTA- It's located in a rural area, not much connectivity is available. It's good if you are not from Kolkata as this is the campus where you are probably gonna get hostel facilities. Campus's huge. The library is also good, you'll get a number of good books. They keep more than one copy too so if exams are there you and your dear friend won't face many problems in issuing the same book. Moot Court available, TOLLYGUNGE, Not much huge but multi-floored, Maximum good faculties are here, Class activities are well maintained, Air-conditioned.

Imran Biswas,Government College of Engineering & Textile Technology - [GCETT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.0,PROS AND CONS OF JOINING GCETTB,"First of all the fee structure of our college is very affordable for almost everybody, it's somewhere around 15000 per year for computer science and engineering department and for others it is even lower 6000 per year.

Even various scholarships are also available with which you can easily pay for other expenses like books, laptop, mess rent if you're home is far from the college. You can apply for the SVMCM scholarship which pays 60000 per year or Aikyashree and MOMA which is available for minorities. There are many other scholarship schemes but these are the major ones but one thing, in order to avail of the scholarship your family's annual income should be below 3 lakhs and you should've secured 75% marks in your 12th board examination.

The placement scenario for CSE and TT branches is pretty well but for EE and ME branches it's not that great. Many reputed companies like TCS, WIPRO, COGNIZANT, RAYMOND, ADOBE, ORACLE, etc visit campus to hire students. The package varies from 3 LPA to 12 LPA."

Priyanka Patra,Maharaja Purna Chandra Autonomous College - [MPC],,7.8,A journey worth sharing,As my course is MSc in Industrial Chemistry it is purely based on industrial applications.

As they include two specific papers one is research paper and regular chemistry paper which is better for the students like me who want to study further for lectureship and for research (PhD).

Student (Anonymous),Universal College of Engineering,"BE, Information Technology",8.0,About my college,"I wanted this course cause I am not into that much hardware and I really really like software and I was really focused on what I needed and after a long journey, I got atleast the course I wanted. Faculties student ratio according to me is quite less than being full perfect cause there are teachers who really teach few subjects at the same time but different years so I cannot say it's perfect but it's very close to perfect. The faculty is something which really boosted a lot of confidence in me so yeah there are some like great faculties in here and about the qualifications, there are few teachers done PhD and few non PhD.

Today's student is not afraid of such an exam.  On the contrary, unpreparedness yields far more than its ability due to an examination system and examination environment. Which was a lot easier then than it is today.  At that time you would fill-up the form as per the due date and then you would be admitted to a notice board according to your merit as per the given time. Different category vise would be arranged in a nice way.  As per the demand. But in college at present, the fees are very high.  Which was very low at that time. The fee should be higher but it is better if it is affordable to a weaker class student. So that it will be easier for all the students to get admission.  Some even good or gifted students drop out of school. Our future is very bad for the future of our country. I have got a good safe place through my college studies. I have got a job."

The student is to teacher ratio is I would say very normal like per 60 students there is a student which is not very good or very bad for a university holding more than 30000 students. The qualifications of teachers were very nice almost every teacher is a pg graduate teacher and was in the field of research and development fields few teachers were also PhD graduates. The timing of term exams was also good but to be very honest somewhere the exam's they conduct they give us very minimal time to prepare and also the end term examination was also very much taken by them well before the time of exam of other colleges and universities so all in all its alright.

Anand Dubey,Chandigarh University - [CU],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.3,Brief about Chandigarh University,So I choose the course of Bachelor of Engineering in the field of Computer Science and Engineering because as we know how the trend is going in the present scenario as there is a huge demand of Computer Science and Engineering students as the advancement of technology increasing day by day there is need for more and more engineering students. The student is to teacher ratio is I would say very normal like per 60 students there is a student which is not very good or very bad for a university holding more than 30000 students. The qualifications of teachers were very nice almost every teacher is a pg graduate teacher and was in the field of research and development fields few teachers were also PhD graduates. The timing of term exams was also good but to be very honest somewhere the exam's they conduct they give us very minimal time to prepare and also the end term examination was also very much taken by them well before the time of exam of other colleges and universities so all in all its alright.

In Mjcet a EEE class consists of 60 students.

The structure around which our course is designed is helpful without any pressure and moreover, all the important subjects are covered already. The subjects which are taught are really important for the future and are really taught very well by our excellent faculty and teachers. Talking about the student:  faculty ratio, I must say it is one of the most appropriate ratios ever seen. As we study 4 subjects in one semester so the ratio is about 4:60, as there are 60 students in one section and there are 2 sections which make it 120 students in all. Moreover, our extra curriculum subjects such as computer classes and personality development classes include two more professional teachers. The teachers are highly educated with decent designation, they all have a unique way of teaching their subjects in a most easy way. They complete their course perfectly as it is a semester-based program and the exams could be passed with sincerity in classes and hard work."

technical events and DJ nights are great attractions for the campus students and also for the other campuses in Patiala.

We had a huge library (Bhai Naba Singh Library), which is the biggest library in terms of the books available in Punjab. you would get every book you want and you can issue a book for 14 days if you are from the general category and for 6 months if you are from other categories. I don't understand this rule basically.

Sports grounds are there and we have sports tracks as well, Basketball ground, Football ground, Tennis courts, and Archery courts as well.

We are one of the top universities that won the Maulan Abul kalam Azad Trophy for 5 6 times in punjab.

Student (Anonymous),Budge Budge Institute of Technology - [BBIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.0,"Good College and a little Expensive - [BBIT], Kolkata","Social life is awesome at BBIT if you are an extrovert. The College organizes multiple events every year, like freshers, competitions parties, concerts, and many more. In the previous two years before covid lockdown once Badsha and once Honey Singh came for the concerts.

Along with the enjoyment the main thing study is enforced here. You will get all your books from the library for the entire semester to study, and also extra books are available other than the syllabus for study and also newspapers to read over there. Just stay quiet in the library.

Classrooms are pretty good and large enough to hold all the students in a class. In most cases, benches are empty for obvious not 100% attendance.

If you are living in the hostel then you can be a part of different activities but your study might hamper due to no extra time for curriculum activities. Playing grounds are there, like football, basketball, and cricket. Also, the seminar hall was empty for dance and other activities. Just you need permission for these."
Abhishek kumar,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.3,Review from a 2k19 batch student,"Anual fest name is culfest. And the techno fest name is . Generally these are conducted in nove-dec. 
Books are there in library but librarian is very bad. Many boys have to face problems while taking books from library. 
Sports are good but not in that way. If you are a good player of any game then the sports team will induct you otherwise if you want to learn any game there is no space for you. 
There are many clubs which run by students. Like- photography and filmmaking club phocus, ahwahan etc"

Vaibhav Vats,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology University - [JIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.4,Opportunities in JIIT(in 2021),"The life at campus is what you make if it, there is enough going on in the campus like festivals, seminars, coding events, etc that will keep you busy. The library is decent but students mostly just use it as a quiet place for studying. It doesn't have lakhs of books. First year is the prime time for taking part in different festivals, coding groups, electronics groups or enjoy the Noida lifestyle full of restaurants and clubs. Being in the middle of Noida is the biggest strength and weakness. Due to being in Noida college campus isn't very expensive, there is a cemented football, basketball ground and a garden (not for playing) and that's about it due to the shy high rent of land in Noida. But being in the middle of one of India's most developed parts means easy access to every food item you can think of, every thing can be delivered to you, grocery can be delivered within 2 hours from Amazon and you feel connected unlike a lot of colleges with giant campuses but in a desolate area. There are a lot of companies right besides the college, my roommate got an internship in one of those. Infrastructure is new and very well maintained, really well maintained. There's a metro station right in front of the college that gives access to every corner of Delhi ncr, we used it to go on many trips across Delhi. Just buy a metro card and travel is seamless and air conditioned.So overall if you an outgoing person, this is literally the best you can get in terms of college location. If you don't go out, delivery on you doorstep is best and fastest anywhere in India. The college doesnt have as many activities as say an IIT, and don't expect superstars on the campus for the festivals either."

The overall placement percentage per year is about 35-40% of the total strength. Students often opt for higher studies later on after the completion of BTech due to lack of placement capabilities.

It was compulsory to go for internships but the choice of hotels and location was on the student to take a call.
I choose Bangalore to do my internship.
There is a 4 month internship which we did which included all the 4 core departments of a hotel. 
One thing to note is that the work culture is very difficult in industrial training(internship).
We had to work in the restaurant outlets rooms and banquets of the hotels.
The shift timings were almost 9-12 hours depending on the situation and rush at the hotels. 
We were made to serve guests in restaurants, clean rooms at Housekeeping, do check in and check out at the front office and chop vegetables and garnish dishes at the kitchen.
Overall it's a huge learning curve and this includes a lot of hard work and dedication.

The University is just within a radius of 2km from my home as well. The quality of education is above average and these reasons were the main motivation for me to join the institute. The quality of education totally depends on which branch you choose. Since I?Ûªm from mechanical branch, the professors are very good from my perspective. The admission process is fairly simple. As per the counselling from CET, you choose the college using the code mentioned in the online process, later you arrive at the college at the given time slot and date. Pay the college fee (?â_55321) for 1st year by hard cash or Demand draft. Your admission is confirmed. The above procedure is for aided seats and unaided seats (fee is different). For management seats, you?Ûªll have to enquire at the main office (located inside the university). One of the main reasons for preferring this college over the others is the placements. The placement training starts during the 3rd year and recruitment?Ûªs starts at the beginning of 4th year. It has proved 100% placements every year. Though the placements are 100% for only CS and ECE branches, other branches also get ample number of recruiters compared to other colleges. For more information (Faculty info, infrastructure, etc.) you can also visit ?ÛÏJssstuniv?Û website. The campus is very huge and is the most cleanest campus in the whole Mysore.

One senior also grabbed a package of 7LPA from Infosys last year and some also grabbed job opportunities from TCS, etc. This year the highest package is of a 4th-year senior and that is 13 LPA, this year also some students grabbed Job opportunities from TCS, etc. The average package in the college is around 3LPA. The placement percentage is roughly 5%. But if you are having the latest skills you can easily grab a good package off-campus. Some students usually prefer to do M.

The campus placements are a bit less in number. As the college is situated far from the city so the companies usually don't prefer to come over here. The TNP cell along with the teachers tries their best to get the companies on campus though. Usually, the students go for off-campus placements. Recently one of our seniors grabbed a package of 13 LPA. Some got placed in TCS with a package of around 4 LPA. The students also participate in the pool placement drives and some of them get placed with an average of 5 to 7 LPA. The placement percentage is about 10% as far as I know. Generally, the students go for MTech or MBA afterwards in the hope of getting good placement opportunities.

The teaching method was more or less the same, with ppts and demos and assignments. We never had a problem with exam not being held on time. I think the first two years were easy to pass but I regret not getting better grades because the rest two years got hard for me. Specially my core courses as I started losing interest in CSE, I found it hard to keep up and it made my CGPA dip.
