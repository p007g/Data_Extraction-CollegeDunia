Shanmukhi,Vignan's Institute Of Engineering For Women,"B.Tech, Information Technology",8.0,"""My review about my VIEW college""","I've chosen IT as my course because everything in this world is now connected to technology, so I've opted for it. There is a good number of faculty for students on the campus. Some highly qualified teachers are appointed as faculty with their working experience as prior. The minimuMTechlification of faculty is mtech. The faculty uses different styles of teaching methods like filp the classroom, zigzag method, etc on students to enhance their knowledge quickly. This kind of technology improves the skills of the students and also impacts a lot of their learning styles. Every semester is scheduled for 6 months according to that the mid exams are conducted with 3 units as a part. I think it's not that difficult to pass an exam because it's enough if you study any 3 units completely, then it's easy to pass with more than the average marks."
Dhruv,IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],,9.0,IIT Madras Review,"The campus is culturally diverse, and we have the opportunity to learn from people from all over the world.

Pratham Dani,Malaviya National Institute of Technology - [MNIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.2,MNIT Jaipur: A brief Insight,The annual fest conducted is BLITZLAG. It is conducted in February every year. The library here is top-notch and with the availability of plenty of books for current Engineering classes. Classrooms are pretty good and ambient for students with full AC'S wifi and comfortable seating. Sports & extracurricular activities are good.

Aparakshit,Anna University - [AU],"MBA, Finance",8.4,ANNA University Review,"Here comes its most interesting aspect of the college, despite the fact that the college is a little out of date. The social scene is extremely enjoyable and welcoming. I have had the greatest social life available to me at times. In the teaching complex, all classrooms have a projector, whereas labs and study areas are located separately for each subject. The University also has a large field where all of the indoor/outdoor games can be played. There is also a separate swimming pool that charges Rs 50 per hour. There are over 50 clubs at the college, including the NCC, NSS, YRC, NSO, and many others. We are free to select taking an interest in clubs and collaborate with them throughout their college careers."
Arohit,Malaviya National Institute of Technology - [MNIT],"MBA, General",8.4,MNIT Jaipur Review,"Our curriculum was divided into four semesters during our two-year journey. The first two semesters were all about core courses, and the last two semesters were all about reading specialised papers in addition to core courses. During the summer between the first and second years. We were evaluated using a variety of in-class assessment systems. We did case studies, quizzes, project reports, and other activities in addition to classroom instruction. The faculty's quality is never jeopardised at the college. The college's faculty is highly experienced and professional. The majority of the faculty are PhDs with industrial experience, which is extremely beneficial to us. The professors are experts in their fields."

The college's infrastructure and building are well managed and maintained. The classrooms are large and open. The college campus is always clean, thanks to the college's housekeeping staff.

They explain everything in a very good manner. There are 20 students in the mechatronics department in my batch, so from this, you can think what is the ratio of faculties and students. As I already mentioned that faculties are very educated and knowledgeable. Now if we talk about term exams so the schedule of exams is the same as all other IIIT and NIT. Maybe this can differ by one or two weeks that's all. And if we talk about passing the subject so the copy checking is very lenient, all teachers are very supportive. If you keep your attention in class then you can easily pass the examination."

This made the overall learning experience great. Also, summer courses on special Chemical Engineering software were provided at the end of the first semester.
