Student (Anonymous),Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Tech, Biotechnology",7.8,Great college offering varied opportunities,"I chose Btech in biotechnology specifically as coming from a medical background it came naturally to me, my interest in microbiology and genetic engineering, secondly the scope of the course goes beyond our country and is widespread across many continents, research as well as industrial jobs are plentiful and high paying and also unlike the IT sector, it's not oversaturated.
On campus, we have approx 35-40k students including those pursuing PhD, Bsc, Msc, and 4-year Btech courses. As a result, the student-to-teacher ratio is relatively high, and there is fierce competition for securing a particular faculty member. However, all the faculty on campus hold PhD degrees, and many of them have multiple patents. We are predominantly taught in English, thus removing the language barrier. Moreover, the teaching style incorporates the whiteboard and presentations thus making learning very exciting. Exams are fairly easy to pass and are CAT exams every two months and end sem FAT's after 6 months."

Teesha goyal,Lakshmi Narain College of Technology - [LNCT],"BE, Information Technology",7.0,"My experience at LNCT, BHOPAL","Campus placements start in semester 7 but college takes placements seriously and they start preparing you in the early semesters.  The training and placement department organises various classes, mock tests, mock interviews, and assistance to help students score better placements.  In my year 2023, the highest on-campus package was 20 lpa and off-campus was 1.14 crore per annum.  In CS/IT, we get around 90% placement, which decreased in 2023 because of the recession and decline in the corporate market.  I got placed in a product-based company from on-campus placements. I am currently interning there."
Jayesh Sonawane,Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology - [DYPIT] Pimpri,"BE, Computer Engineering",8.0,The story of 4years that reshaped me and my career,"Many Clubs are active in college and they conduct multiple events throughout the year. Sanskrit is the biggest cultural fest conducted annually. PARAKRAM the sports fest is also conducted annually. In addition to that, all the other clubs of the respective branches conducted multiple coding, hacking, Treasure hunt, and more events.
The college campus size is too short as compared to IIT or NITS or as you have seen in movies. But the college environment is precious and luxurious.
Aces, and CSI are clubs associated with the computer dept.
TESA is associated with ENTC
 RAPTORS is a robotic club.
INTERCEPTOR is a racing club and many more clubs are there for every department"

Sneha S,IIM Sirmaur,"MBA, General",9.0,IIM Sirmaur - Plethora of opportunities,"The course for our year was offered for a fee of Rs 11,85,000. This was inclusive of hostel fees which are Rs10,000 per month. The mess fees are separate. It costs Rs18,000 per term. 
For the candidates coming from financially backward classes or belonging to SC, ST, or OBC approximately 1 lakh is provided as a scholarship. 
For most of the IIMs, there is a tie-up with local banks which indeed helps in offering loans to the students at lesser interest rates. For IIM Sirmaur, we got emails from the Central Bank of India, State Bank of India, and Union Bank of India with interest rates of 6.7, 6.75, and 7.2 per annum respectively. 
Since we are currently on the temporary campus, the course fee is less, once we move to a permanent campus with more facilities the fees will see a hike. For the academic year 2023-25 itself, the fees have been increased to Rs16,00,000.
The institute offers campus placements and IIMs always see a hike in their campus placements. This year our average placement is Rs11,82,000."

Faculties are good at teaching in this college with good amount of knowledge and qualification but some faculties are not supportive. There are two test and 1 exam for each semester is taken and the difficulty level is moderate in exams.
