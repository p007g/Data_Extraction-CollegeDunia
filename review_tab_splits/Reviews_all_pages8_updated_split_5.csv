This is the hard part of BTech. Although the paper is set in my MGIT. It is very hard to pass the exam if you will not behave properly. Teachers will catch you and will reduce your marks if you are not a disciple. MGIT  has closed gates throughout the year. Only when some events happen do they have an open gate but this is also restricted for certain year students. Teachers are qualified and teach very good. They are well designated and have very good knowledge of the subject. Clear any doubts students ask. Exams will be without preparation holiday. So prepare well to get passed. Mgit has different passing criteria. If you fail one exam you have to write supplementary exams again by paying fees next."

KUSHAGRA RATHORE,Government Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.0/10,Engineering College Ajmer review  by CSE 2nd  year student,"We have many types of fests approx per month 1 fest and recently there was a fun fest in my college where my team came 1st in Scavenger Hunt and we got passes to Nearby Water park. 
There is a big library in my college issuing books for 2 weeks and also a BB (Book Bank ) from where we can get books for each semester approx for 6 months and we do not have to buy books from outside. 
The alumni network of my college is huge but now very active we just have 1 meeting virtually per week 
Sports and extracurricular activities are there for every student who wants to take part and is interested in playing games like cricket, volleyball, kho kho badminton and indoor games like chess, carrom, table tennis, etc"

Karan gandhi,SRM University Delhi NCR,"BCA, General",8.0/10,A very affordable University with all the modern-day facilities.,"The annual fests, the tech fests and any other fests are conducted for all the students within two months of admission of the freshers. The library are well equipped with all the books and resources. There are tournaments for both students and teachers for sports and extra curricular activities and all the equipment are within the college sports complex which you can issue.

Student (Anonymous),Assam Down Town University - [ADTU],"BA, Psychology",6.4/10,"I would recommend this university, if you want to take psychology.","We have an annual fest called ""Attitude"", where various performers come from all over the world. It's usually held in an Amphitheater, where most of the students don't even fit in. Their planning of the university is quite poor. It was supposed to be a hospital but it made it into a university. 
They don't have any books on psychology in the library, so our faculties took the initiative to open a small library in the psychology lab. 
Only a few classes have projectors and a whiteboard. Most of the classes go with the traditional blackboard and chalks.  Sports are not given any priority and no information about clubs is given until the very end, and every club is run by teachers. So if a student wants to open a club, we can't even do that. We don't have any social groups or clubs or websites which are run by students.  Our college does keep many competitions to increase the engagement of the students for extra curriculum activities."
