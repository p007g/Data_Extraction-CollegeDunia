As of now I am in the 1st semester itself so we have 6 subjects in all for this semester, and only 1 out of all is a law subject, the other subjects are BA subjects which aren't very interesting, talking about the Faculty, some of the faculty members are very amazing like the Torts faculty is very good, economics faculty is also very good, moreover they are the ones who have perfect I depth knowledge about their subjects and that is seen when they teach you. some faculty members are not up to the mark as they lack a deep understanding of the subject that they are teaching, even some of the student's doubts blow their minds. For the 1st year, we have in total 8 faculty members for all the subjects for in total of 120 students which is quite decent. you can expect exams every 1.5 months which are midterms, and easy to pass."

Sivani,Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College,"B.Sc, Physical Science with Chemistry",8.6/10,Internship program,"I choose this course because loved science and wasn't sure about what to opt for if I had to choose one. So I opted for this course because it had all the subjects like maths, chemistry, and physics as main courses and a variety of optional courses which changes every semester. Like I had an environmental science course, a communication skill course, and mathematical computation which includes latex, Fortran, wolfram,  etc. So it provided so much diversity in a single course. The student ratio is pretty well in our course as we nearly have 50 students due to which every student got to perform well and are under the eyes of teachers. All the teachers are well-qualified PhD holders and still doing their research work, even some have written books on the perspective subjects they teach. The chemistry faculty is the best among all the faculties from which I have been taught, and the laboratory classes are well-instructed. We have exams every 6 months and are easy to pass."

Muntasir Rahman,Murshidabad Medical College & Hospital,"MBBS,",8.0/10,I am satisfied to this college,"The course is extremely lengthy. It has vigorous pressure. The course curriculum is 5.5 years including a 1-year internship. Though all faculty member is genius. They are all specialists in their field. They are also friendly, good guides, and motivators with few exceptions. Those few exceptional teachers are always ready to burn behind the bamboo for the student. I basically choose this field because it is a chance to serve the man me. And it is the better pathway to earn the money. The faculty and students ratio is enough. There is a limited seats in every medical college. But currently, there is an increasing trend of medical colleges in our state that will do bad conditions for the future. The qualification of the faculty is very excellent. They are high degree holders in their field. The teaching method depends on the teacher. Though most of the teachers use PPT (PowerPoint presentation), some of us do board work, in demonstration classes, and the practical class uses the original instrument or human body."

Faculties are good but you need to work hard for yourself because, in colleges, there is no spoon-feeding. Everything you do, you do for yourself. All the faculties are ph.d. graduates and well qualified. If I talk about exams then there are 8 semesters (i.e. 4 years) and there are two exams per semester (mid-term and end-term)."
