Yash Badhwar,Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology - [DCRUST],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0,"My amazing journey to follow my dreams at DCRUST, Murthal","I chose B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication as the course gives experience and advantage of both worlds, private IT sector as well as an advantage in govt. Jobs. Though the syllabus is harder than any other branch in B.Tech. but the faculty is friendly and solves all doubts. Teachers are a little hesitant if students call them but any student can drop a WhatsApp message to any of the faculty and the student will get a reply ASAP. Talking about faculty: student ratio, it's not quite good as we have 2 divided with approx 71 students in each, so the faculty: student ratio can be said as 1:71 for Electronics and Communication but teachers are really helpful and solve queries of every student.
All faculty is well qualified and maximum teachers have a PhD in the subject they teach. And when it comes to exams,  all exams were taken timely even in covid pandemics. Though ECE is considered the hardest branch but the exams were quite based on practical knowledge rather than cramming books."

They prefer knowledgeable and hardworking candidates for the job. The lowest salary you may get is 6-7 lacks per year. And the maximum pay depends on your ability and skill. The companies are big enough to start. Big brands like Google, Wipro, etc come for placements. Even I got placed and joined a company (I won't take the name though) with a monthly salary of 30000 but since I wanted to pursue higher studies so I dropped out of it after attending 2-3 days and realized I cant manage both the things together.

Yogeshwar saini,BSA College of Engineering and Technology - [BSACET],,5.4,Caring for a student life,This college is good in faculties whether self finance course or regular course but there are some negative points are that the rules and regulations are not proper. the process of admission criteria in this College is offline. The reason for preferring this college is that the distance between my house and this college is only 5 km. The advertisement of this college is only in Mathura so there is no any website for selecting this college.
Student (Anonymous),Goa Institute of Management - [GIM],"PGDM, General",7.0,GIM - God's own campus.,"I applied for the flagship Post graduate diploma in management course at GIM. The course boasts a batch strength of 240 students each. GIM has 75 plus full-time faculty.
Usually, one can find 100 plus students opting for marketing majors in GIM. Finance majors are 50 plus and Ops and HR are 30 and 20 respectively. these are rough figures which change every year.
the professors hold PhDs in their area of expertise. there are few with masters but they come with vast industry experience.

srimanth mahadev kancharla,RVR and JC College of Engineering,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.0,RVR & JCCE IN A NUTSHELL,"The fee structure is very reasonable. Even the bus facility is cheap compared to any other college in AP. The hostel fee and everything are reasonable. College is always in favor of students. We have a fee structure of around 1,08,000/- in I/IV BTech (1st year) then there is a decrease in fees in our 2nd year. to 69,400/-. College management instructed us to pay only 30,800/- as a 2nd-year fee because we paid a full fee in 1 year. By this, you can understand How much our college is in our favor. There are a lot of scholarships offered by our college and also they will be in the first place to instruct to apply for scholarships given by the government or any other organization. Right now I'm in 3rd year. I'm sure I will get a good job and step out of my education. That's my confidence in my college."

Now the Faculty of HN is worst i could say. If any student is thinking to pursue BCA from HN in 2021 further HN is not an option for you. Faculties are moreover interested in your personal life rather than focusing on teaching. Faculties and even computer labs are also Very outdated, they are using windows 7 and visual studio 2010 and asking you also to use vs 2010. If you're a self-learner then ok, because after completing bca from HN studying only what they teach to you you're not getting a job on it! So I suggest you do not pursue BCA from HN!"

The course is good but the teachers here are really bad. In each semester, you'll hardly get one or two good teachers and sometimes even not that.  The infrastructure of this university is great but they don't pay attention to teachers. Teachers who are doing physics are asked to teach Java Language. Such is the condition here."

Every subject taught in the semester has a different teacher for it and for guiding a group of 15-20 students is under 1 teacher. Teachers were fairly qualified some were phd holders and some were doing their phd while teaching, teaching method composed of both the traditional method (textbook method) and the modern method (case study, articles)
Exams were taken semester-wise as per the IP guidance but assignments were given monthly in the form of articles, case studies, and written assignments. Exams depend on how the student studies college doesn't have control over that all they can do is teach you how you should tackle it."

Sarthak Ray,IIT Guwahati - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITG],,9.2,Virtues of the most beautiful campus of India.,"Well frankly I chose this course because my marks didnt make it feasible for me to opt for a higher branch. But I have no regrets moving forward as I still get to do what any other CSE student gets to do. I code full time along with my Minor degree in Product Design, which makes me love what I do. Yes, IITG lets you procure a minor degree which adds a lot of value to your future career. Coming to the qualification of faculty, every single faculty member in IITG has a PhD. Aditionally IITG is second in India in terms of citations/faculty. So clearly, the faculty here is highly competent. Needless to say their teaching methods are exceptional, and that is my review just from an online perspective. One would guess that their offline method of teaching must be just mind-blowing.  Exams held in my college is pretty tough, as in there is no direct solution which can be found in any book or online. All the questions are framed by our faculty itself and it needs a good understanding of the topic."

There are also many recruiters who come to the campus and offer jobs. In addition, the programme fee of 5 lakhs for two years is too low when compared to other colleges in the city that charge much higher fees for similar programmes. So, these were the main reasons I chose to enroll in the MBA programme at my University. Registration was the first step in getting into this college. Then I used my login credentials to fill out the application form, and finally I paid the application fee of Rs. 1000/- via the internet. One can visit their official website for more information which is www.hindustanuniv.ac.in."

Sidharth Bhawani,Model Institute of Engineering and Technology - [MIET],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.8,B.E CSE @MIET Jammu [Review by 1st year(2nd Sem) student],"I chose this college over others because I was not able to clear JEE mains exam and didn't got any college outside Jammu so I decided to go for JKCET and do my engineering in my own city. And the another reason was the faculty of MIET Jammu. Specially in my CSE department the professors are excellent and highly qualified. They will do everything to provide the best things to their students. Students should also try to give the best if the professors are working on for their betterment of the future. Here, only one who strive for success or is ready to face any challenge and want to keep learning and grow with time can achieve best things in his/her life. In this college if anyone tries to underestimate his/her skills or if the person will not make sufficient efforts to learn something new then he/she will not be successful and end up just complaining about the college.The bad aspect of this college is that you will not get too much like minded students. In my batch there are very less number of students who are serious about their career. But it's all about time. They might get awakened one day and work on for the betterment of their future. Another thing is that the placements are not so good. The highest package offered in 2021 was 13 LPA and only service based companies like-TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc visit for campus placements.Lastly I want to say that if anyone want to do CSE from Jammu after giving the JKCET examination then this college is best because after completing the engineering the college will assist you for higher studies and you can go for higher studies in US or any other country or even prepare for GATE to get job in PSU or do M-TECH/M.S from IIT/NIT or IISC or any other top college of India. It all depends upon you want you want to do in your life."

The term exams were on time, There weren't any delays in the exam. Although the results came out a bit late than usual. I found it difficult in the first semester because I had switched from Science to English but after the first semester, I passed my exams pretty easily once I got into it."

In my university our batch was second. so, we don't have many ratios we were about 15 to 16 students in one batch and we have almost 6 to 7 faculty. Every faculty in my department was a Ph.D. holder. And their way of teaching was very impressive I have learned so many things from my professor.  2 times and it was not that difficult but not that easy too. If you have given all the attention in your classes and listen to your professors then at the time of exams you just need a little bit of sitting for the preparation for the exams because the faculty in my university teaches very well."

They not only provide theoretical knowledge but also conduct practicals, webinars, conferences, etc. As the college comes under the University of Delhi, therefore the syllabus is almost the same as the other colleges.

There are also many recruiters who come to the campus and offer jobs. In addition, the programme fee of 5 lakhs for two years is too low when compared to other colleges in the city that charge much higher fees for similar programmes. So, these were the main reasons I chose to enroll in the MBA programme at my University. Registration was the first step in getting into this college. Then I used my login credentials to fill out the application form, and finally I paid the application fee of Rs. 1000/- via the internet. One can visit their official website for more information which is www.hindustanuniv.ac.in."
Sharnik Datta,TAPMI Manipal,,8.9,TAPMI REVIEW,"Apart from work and studies, TAPMI offered a lot of clubs and committees to work with and have a work-life balance.

Sidharth Bhawani,Model Institute of Engineering and Technology - [MIET],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.8,B.E CSE @MIET Jammu [Review by 1st year(2nd Sem) student],"I chose this college over others because I was not able to clear JEE mains exam and didn't got any college outside Jammu so I decided to go for JKCET and do my engineering in my own city. And the another reason was the faculty of MIET Jammu. Specially in my CSE department the professors are excellent and highly qualified. They will do everything to provide the best things to their students. Students should also try to give the best if the professors are working on for their betterment of the future. Here, only one who strive for success or is ready to face any challenge and want to keep learning and grow with time can achieve best things in his/her life. In this college if anyone tries to underestimate his/her skills or if the person will not make sufficient efforts to learn something new then he/she will not be successful and end up just complaining about the college.The bad aspect of this college is that you will not get too much like minded students. In my batch there are very less number of students who are serious about their career. But it's all about time. They might get awakened one day and work on for the betterment of their future. Another thing is that the placements are not so good. The highest package offered in 2021 was 13 LPA and only service based companies like-TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc visit for campus placements.Lastly I want to say that if anyone want to do CSE from Jammu after giving the JKCET examination then this college is best because after completing the engineering the college will assist you for higher studies and you can go for higher studies in US or any other country or even prepare for GATE to get job in PSU or do M-TECH/M.S from IIT/NIT or IISC or any other top college of India. It all depends upon you want you want to do in your life."

DAISY AHUJA,TAPMI Manipal,,7.9,Know TAPMI to the Core!,"I chose PGDM General, though I was shortlisted for PGDM- BKFS (Banking and Financial Services) too.
I opted for this because I did want to explore multiple domains in the first year of the Programme and then decide which area to specialize in. I applied for BKFS considering a bit of inclination in the finance domain due to past experience.
Also PGDM General allows us to opt for Majors and Minors both in our second year and we get to choose from a number of options.

The faculty-student ratio is 1:3.

All faculty are highly qualified. Many are PHDs and are also actively involved in research and publishing papers. the teaching pedagogy at TAPMI is highly industry-relevant and experiential. Also, all courses in the program follow case-based teaching methods.

The bus connectivity is good but the route is always busy hence, going by own vehicle is a good option.

Devesh,TAPMI Manipal,,7.9,TAPMI Review 2021,"TAPMI provides specialised courses in Marketing, HR, Banking and Financial Services, and a  PGDM(Core) program. Though I had interests in multiple domains, I could not align myself that early for a specialised course. Hence, I opted for the PGDM(Core) program where the course structure would gradually help me align my interests towards a specific domain. Few courses also have primer courses to help students familiarize themselves and get hold of the basics of the subjects.
Faculties include professionals with work experience in multiple industries and rich in academics. The faculty student ratio at TAPMI is 1:9. 
The teaching pedagogy involves thought and process oriented learning to give structure to how to address problems and address possible solutions.

Most of the students in the college are from outside Pune. They are pure Marathi crowds.

SOUMYA RANJAN PRADHAN,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"M.Tech, Production Engineering",9.1,A brief idea about M.Tech at NIT Rourkela,"As a M.Tech student you can expect a lot of software and analytics companies during the placement season. For M.Tech the placement starts from 3rd semester onwards. For mechanical core companies, the number is lesser as compared to software companies. But overall the placement is good. If you really need a job you can definitely get one here. I personally recommend you to go for atleast one programming language irrespective of any branch. They allow every specialization students for software jobs.Companies like TCS, Capgemini, EPAM, Code Nation, etc. are coming every single year. For core companies you can expect Tata steel, Bajaj Auto, GE, BHEL, etc.Keep in mind that most of the corr companies eligible the students having only 1year education gap after B.Tech. So prepare according to that. But software companies give some relaxation in this regards. For placement package you can't expect any number. But on an average you can get around 5-6L CTC for M.Tech people.Many students prefer higher studies as well. They go for Phd. in reputed IITs, IISC and aslo some foreign Universities after their M.Tech."

Practical classes are also held regularly but practical equipment is not up to date they are mostly old and do not work. There are a total of 6 semesters i.e one year 2 semester question paper is of 80 marks and  20 marks are for assignments, attendance and presentation.

But due to covid all the exams are in objective pattern only. By the way objective exams are comparatively easy."

V Raja Patro,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Metallurgical And Materials Engineering",6.8,Worthy Course metallurgy at NIT Rourkela,First of all according to my jee main rank I got this branch.It was there in my mind that this branch hadn't too much scopes and opportunities.I thought that I should prefer a second tier college with good branch but I continued with this 1st tier college in metallurgy branch which is not considered as a good branch according to placement package and opportunities in comparison with other branches.Anyhow all the 1st year students have to read same course which is basic and fundamental of all the branch.I tried to change my branch but online semester had some different scenarios rather than offline.So my CG's wouldn't good to change.I continued with my branch.But when I became a sophomore then I got the chance to learn from my branch's professors.All the profesor my branch are very cooperative and excellent in their specialization.Total college's student number is around 7000 and professor number is 365 .In my branch 17 professors are there and all are with doctorate degree and highly educated.In my college metallurgy course is very good although it doesn't provide large and higher placements like IT sector but NITR's placement record is good.Lots of students get the chance to do their MS from reputed Western college's with their research work and teacher's are very cooperative.

Student (Anonymous),University Institute of Engineering and Technology -[UIET],"BE, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.2,better option to choose than lower/newer NITs,"If I talk about the course curriculum of UIET, I will say it's decent. In a semester, we have 1 end-sem exam (majors) of 50 marks, 2 mid-sem exams of 30 marks each (minors) out of which best of both is considered, and 20 marks are in hands of teachers (which includes attendance, class participation, quizzes, ppts, assignment etc). Here, you will get all kind of professors, some are excellent, some are good, teaches well and on the other hands, few are not so good. But still, no doubt,  almost all professors have huge experience and holds Dr. before their name. 
You don't have to worry much about CGPA in UIET. Just a basic understanding of the subject and smartly studying a week before the exam can help you in getting good marks on the paper. 1st and 2nd semesters are the easiest ones, so there is an opportunity to score a good CGPA. Moreover,  students even studying a night before exams manage to maintain a decent CGPA. It's just a matter of doing smart work, which you may learn too in UIET."

And about the faculty of the college so let me tell you they all are professionals in their fields, helpful, friendly and sometimes really strict as well, they all know how to make students understand the Importance of the subject. They all have at least 5 years of experience in teaching and they love doing it and some are also PhD holders. The university conducts the Term exams very well and is very accurate about it. Honestly, if you will study with discipline you can and will pass any exam irrespective of how difficult it is but to be more descriptive it was pretty difficult as you need to be very active with your mind whilst doing your exam but I think its also necessary to enhance one's practical knowledge."
Pranav Raj,RKDF University,"BE, Civil Engineering",9.0,Short tour to my college.,"I choose this course because it has a lot of scopes both in private and government jobs, also my sister and father studied this course and provide me with a lot of guidelines.

Shubham Jain,Swami Vivekanand Subharti University - [SVSU],"B.Sc, Physics",6.9,My campus life,"I have chosen this course as I have opted Science stream in 12th as I was interested in science since my childhood and wanted to become a science graduate.In my college class there were around 6 teachers who teach their own subjects throughout the semester.Around 40 students were there in my class and 30 approx came to the class daily.So, we can say there was a 1:30 ratio of teacher and the students which was ok according to Indian study structure.Faculties to came to teach us were almost well qualified having at least master degrees and some of them having doctorate in their subjects.The way of teaching of our teachers was quiet simple and effective as they use both the languages Hindi (our native mother tongue) and English (as the course language).Also I have still remembered their friendly behavior with the students.The exam pattern was divided into 3 steps. The first two were Internal Exams which were conducted after a one third time of the semester, same for second internal that is after two third time of semester and finally semester exams were conducted in the last of the semester.The exam level was neither very tough nor very easy that means moderate.The criteria for passing was 40% marks of total marks."

Many of our faculty have done a PhD or currently doing a PhD teaching method depends on faculty to faculty as well as subject to subject.

Juhi upadhyay,Satyawati College,"BA {Hons.}, English",7.3,"What to expect from Satyawati College, Delhi University","The fests of every college affiliated with DU are a go-to for every college student. Famous, known singers, actors, comedians, etc come for promotions in these fests which are the limelight of the university. These fests are organized in the month of February and every college organizes its own fest based on its budget. Satyawati College has two shifts- morning and evening so two separate fests are organised for them respectively so students get an added perk.

Mostly all the resources are found in the library if by chance all the resources needed are issued then the service of photocopying is also very convenient here. Plus the fine is also moderate if one over exceeds the time limit of returning the books.

For a quality education of merely 8000 per month, a lot of services are provided, hence the classes are not air-conditioned like the private Universities but important places like seminar room, library, labs, girls room, staff room, medical room, society rooms are air-conditioned."

Also knew seniors who studied here who also gave a good recommendation. Liked to management and administration too. Another big reason was the location and in turn, my travel time to the college was favorable. Bad aspects of the college are that they are heavy on fines for every rule broken.

Also knew seniors who studied here who also gave a good recommendation. Liked to management and administration too. Another big reason was the location and in turn, my travel time to the college was favorable. Bad aspects of the college are that they are heavy on fines for every rule broken.

After one year they show their real colours which are also a quite obvious thing as it is a private university.
Talking about the qualification of teachers,  they are basically students who CU itself and almost 70% teachers are young here which means after qualifying from CU they started teaching but the worst part is some of them are really not good in teaching.
Exams are not that much tough if a student tries well then he or she can qualify it with ease."

Student (Anonymous),Lakshmi Narain College of Technology Excellence - [LNCTE],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",4.8,Good for placement but not in education quality,"I chose this because I am interested in this field of programming and want to become a software developer. If I talk about faculties they are all are assistant professors who don't have practical knowledge the facilities are soo bad don't expect anything to learn from college because they only provide placements, not education. You yourself need to study learn no one will help if you don't get the things. The faculties ratio is so high in our department there is a total of 208 students and for this 10 facilities are there so one faculty needs to teach more than one subjects in the same class this shows that they don't provide the knowledge they are just completing the university syllabus."
Jayram Panda,Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology - [VSSUT],"B.Tech, Information Technology",6.4,INSIDE VSSUT BURLA,I wanted to take CSE but since I scored less in jee mains I had to take IT.IT is also as good as CSE. Everything depends on your own effort. If you work hard and get a good CGPA(above8)you will definitely get placed in a very good company. Talking about the faculties they were excellent. I am not saying they were exceptional but they are well trained. They try to motivate us and get ahead in our life. As you know my college had 8 semesters. The semester exams were not too hard if you study well.
Sakshi Vats,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.6,"LPU, leading university in India","I always wanted to pursue BTech in computer science and engineering. And LPU has a very great faculty. There are so many students. But the student's teachers ratio is great. Even during online classes, the online teaching platform is great. At the beginning of each sem, each student is guided by how to take online classes. Teachers clear all the doubts. The official messaging app of Lpu is great. Teachers and students can interact there easily. Facilities are highly qualified and have a great way of teaching. In each sem, there are CAs in each subject which is basically assignment and its marks are added in the result. So assignments are compulsory. And midterm and end term exams are held each sem. Exams are held timely. And if you are studying sincerely then surely you will pass. The Paper is as per the syllabus only. Sometimes some questions are hard while some are easy. So it is kind of moderate."

There are two divisions for us which consist of 80-100 students. Here concepts are analyzed theoretically and are applied practically and I love the way that the syllabus starts taking shape as a blueprint which gives us a better understanding of all the concepts that are taught. The teaching sector is amazing and they take care of each concept and go in-depth while teaching. They also care about the students if they understood the concept individually. All the faculty members hold Ph.D. except the ones who teach us extra subjects like English, Evs, etc. Term exams are mostly of 2:30 hrs and it's not that difficult to pass if you follow the teaching patterns which makes it easy rather than cramming the notes."

After getting suggestions from many friends I ended up choosing mechanical engineering branch . 
In this branch there are about 70 students in my class .

The board conducts exam like internal exams before semester exam . Board takes 3 seasonal exams before the semester examination so that the students get prepared for the semester examination,  this helps students to pass in their exams but still some students are not able to get passed in the semester examination due to lack of their concentration in classroom and in their studies too"

I selected PGDM-Core as it is a general path and in the first year, I will have the liberty to study all the subjects and hence in the second year I can select the major and minors as per my wish. Faculty: student ratio is around 1:60 in every class. The pedagogy used by the faculty is really innovative and interactive here as we learn by case methods, group discussions, simulations. Exams are a daily thing in TAPMI and you have to be prepared at all times."

Student (Anonymous),TAPMI Manipal,,8.9,An Honest Review of TAPMI,"PGDM-Marketing is well-curated course for marketing and sales enthusiasts. Contrary to other PGDM courses in any B-school, this course introduces you to advanced courses of marketing and sales management from term 2 of 1st year itself. The curriculum not only inculcates the concepts of marketing & sales but also aims to broaden your thinking horizons to deal with real-life situations later on. TAPMI's curriculum is AMBA accredited which is international accreditation currently possessed by 2% B-Schools of world. One of the core strengths of TAPMI is its faculty members. Faculty members bring their life experiences to help you make better decisions. You will be surprised to see faculty members who have work experience of 30 years. How incredible it would be to learn from them. All faculty members bring 400 years of work experience with them to give you insights into the problems and solutions."

Wait, let me explain you thorough example. 
For example- 1st sem starts from March. So we have  now March, April, May , June. And july is for end sem exam.
So 1st internal UT conducted on april and then after one month...so basically 2 time UT in and at last they take PUT(Pre university Test). 
Which contains all syllabus.
After this let's talk about difficulty of exams. The level of exam is average...no neee to study more or out of college notes...they are enough for AKTU exams. Each paper is of 100 marks and 30 is passing marks. So this task is not much hard. So you can pass the exam easily. 
They provides books and many things..but you need to do is only read there notes...and do practise for maths because practise makes man perfect. 
Checking is little bit different here, which will disappoint you so for getting good marks just practise more and learn more..
You will definitelysucceed"

Yes, I will describe the faculty and student ratio as 1:4 respectively beacuase teachers are used to giving us the only way of learning only and we have to travel on that path by ourselves.
All faculties are M.tech and P.hd holders and their teaching method is also too good.
There are two-term exams in the semester as first one in mid-term and another one is end-term with a gap of 1.5 months and genuinely the level of the exam is too good as if a one should study on the daily basis then he/she can pass the exam with very good marks as for the resulting system we are having the grading system which helps the average students not to fail in there exam so I can say if someone is studying on daily basis then only you are able to pass the exam with good marks only otherwise you will fail."
