They usually have a fixed syllabus which they try to finish and sometimes you and they go really fast at times. But teachers have a great knowledge of subjects as they have great qualifications. The exams are on the fixed time period and we don't get much of time period to study because we are so well versed with the There is a fixed course plan followed throughout the year which hells us to know an overall knowledge in the point of examination.It's really difficult to score high marks in the examinations

The thing about BMMMC is that it tries to cover many different subjects from completely different fields in each semester. 
Its downside is that you just get to touh the surface of each subject but never get to master it enough to make use of it. 
You will have papers like Development communication, Communication Research, Anchoring for news and radio, EVS, theatre, photography, Graphic Designing, Introduction to Journalism etc.


The faculty isn't very qualified. They often hire ex students as teachers. 

Wouldn't name anyone but one lecturer in particular is very rude and sadistic, and she will be teaching you and over through the semesters. Though other lectures are nice and polite.

College provides assistance in the Summer Internships as well as Final Year placements for every student. This year, both of these processes ended by December last week. The official figures for the stipend and the CTC offered are currently not been revealed till now so I can't comment on that.

Student (Anonymous),Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",4.0/10,Honest IIIT Una review,"The faculty members are inexperienced they are helpful but won't be able to help much. I would say it will take 3-4 years for the college to get good placement statistics as its alumni network matures. The college does not appear in the NIRF ranking yet and will take 2-3 years for that. The lack of NIRF ranking hinders companies from visiting campus and qualifies it as tier 3 college hence the poor placement yet few students get good off-campus placement in companies like DE Shaw, Google, CISCO, PayPal, Microsoft. The marking is very strict as the college follows relative marking. If you do not get a good GPA in the first year you are almost doomed for the rest."

Saransh sharma,ABES Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8/10,ABES Review,"I would like to say that there are not so many internship opportunities but yet college faculty is trying to improve internship opportunities and if some students was unable to get an internship so college faculty help those students to make some effective projects so that their CVs make some impact. And there are some internship opportunities for the college students but there are very less seats for the students so many of the students are unable to get the seats booked for themself and if someone can get an internship then he/she will pei provided internship certificate as well as stipend based on your performance. But in my experience, if you want an internship then you have to grab an internship by yourself and there are so many sites and apps that regularly make announcements of the internship some of these I like to mention are LinkedIn, Internshala etc. In college, you have to make a different project which is the minor and major project you have to minor and major projects on your own in 2 and 4 years respectively."

Priyanshu Raushan,K.K. Polytechnic,"Polytechnic, Electrical Engineering",6.3/10,Honest Review of my college after Experience.,": I choose this course because of my interest in Electrical Field. I love to learn about Electricity and its application in the modern Era.

: There are Enough faculty to solve any problem realted with their academics but they are not interested in your activities outside your classroom. The ratio is 1:40

: The faculties are well educated and have M.tech degree holders so they have the idea to explain the topics properly but the only bad thing is they not try again if someone not follows them in first explanation.

: There are two internal and one external exams are taken every semester in which internal exams are taken after every two months which is organised by college and the external exam is taken at the last of semester which is organised by the Board Jharkhand University of technology.
The internal exams are not so difficult because if you have attended all lectures then you can easily pass it. The main challenge is external exam in which you to do hard work to secure good mark"

Student (Anonymous),Poornima Institute of Engineering  and Technology - [PIET],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.0/10,Review about  my college,"The fee structure is also good enough. The college provides a specific time to the students to submit the fee of the college. The annual fee of the college is 70000 and can be increased as the year grow. One thing that disappointed me is taking the exam fee. After paying the college fee (70000) the students also have to pay the exam fees to the college to seat in the exam, and the fee is around 1600 for one semester. Another Disappointment is scholarship the college also focuses on the expenses there is no proper I formation about the scholarship in the college. Only a few students are able to gain the scholarship in the college who fill the form. And the rest of the students are left blank. There are no jobs from the college side as the college is mainly focused on study. They provide the placement but not the internship and the stipend which was very bad. The college provides the courses on some websites which are paid courses and some are free but they are sponsored, and not good."
