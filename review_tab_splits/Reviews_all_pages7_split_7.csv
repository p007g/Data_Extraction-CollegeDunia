Particularly in my branch teachers were very supportive except one or two. The faculty-to-student ratio of our college is 1:20. Many teachers are Phd degree holders and their teaching method is quite conventional. Each year has two semesters and in each semester we have one sessional exam which is considered for theory internal evaluation and final end-term examinations. It is not difficult to pass the examination in ipu the only thing you have to do is to prepare for the end term from the previous year's exam paper.

Proctor is a faculty who is assigned to around 30-40 students as their local guardians if you want to go out you need to take permission from the proctor and parents both of which are difficult because they don't allow it every time. The library is decent you get almost every book which you need.  the classroom is also decent the whole campus has wifi but that also don't work every time, for sports one multipurpose hall is there in which basketball, volleyball, and badminton are played on a single court. football and volleyball ground are there but they don't have proper drainage."

I chose the course since it was quite interesting, but slowly my interest gradually dipped to such an extent that i did projects related to CS branch. Some of the faculty were quite demotivating and burdened us with deadlines, some were good to be honest. One of the many drawbacks is that in ece we were taught 1990s syllabus, which made no sense. This also affected us during our placements where some the students shifted to coding like me, while others are still struggling to bag an offer. Term exams were held timely but the difficulty is above average. If you aint studying their outdated contents by heart you may even fail. And getting a fasttrack in ece at dsce is quite risky, you never know who evaluates your paper and I have seen people getting backlogs, which later proves to be a barrier during placement season.
