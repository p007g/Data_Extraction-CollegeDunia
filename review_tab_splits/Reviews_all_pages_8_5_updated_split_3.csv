Skills such as multitasking, communicating, learning to deal with diversity, and dealing with deadlines are different when you are working for someone else, not yourself like you do in college.  Internships are also a great way to network with people in the industry.  My boss and co-workers were great about giving me contacts and referring me to open positions in the industry. I think that an internship is extremely valuable to a student. It is a small taste of the real world. It helped reinforce my knowledge of responsibility, focus, drive, and ambition. I had to be responsible for people’s money, credit card authorization forms, getting to work on time, fulfilling my word, and completing all of the tasks that I was assigned. I learned focus."

As far as the infrastructure is concerned, I would say it's pretty awesome. It's so huge that you could easily get lost. But jokes aside, it's interesting and the scenery from any point is awesome. No doubt.
Academics
Currently, I'm studying BTech ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATION. It's good and interesting. The faculty is good and easygoing. Practicals are pretty interesting. Classes are chill and often enjoyable. They lack in some places, but it is still good.
Placements
As I heard from the seniors, the placement is pretty neat. They get good packages. They are sure that everyone gets placed. But to get that you need a pretty decent GPA. And this branch is versatile in the job world, so it's good.
Value-for-money
Yeah about this, it's pretty expensive. But it's good though. They make up for it. It cost me 2L per year and pays in three installments. But I think they should reduce the number of fees we pay so that it could be easy for us.

In regarding the job campus there is a huge advantage available in the college. 
Because every year many companies come to the college and hire brave student's who can help their company to grow
Like this year TCS, L&T, such companies came to our college. 
They simply take the aptitude examination. 
And if you crack that examination then they will call you for an interview. 
Then if you crack the interview then you will be called for 6 months of the training period and you will also get paid during the 6 months of training.

There is a total of 5.5 years long course out of which 4.5 years academic and after that 1 year internship in which you get 18000 per month salary.
Mp shah medical college campus is very big and for medical mbbs it is the oldest institution after bj medical college Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
So here teaching is good but the main thing is you get many things to learn in the hospital because here a very big around 1500 beds available in the hospital.
It is the largest hospital in Saurashtra currently.
For mbbs there is a final exam at the end of the year so a total of 4 final exams are taken. Over it, there is an internal exam and preliminary exam taken every year after that final exam is taken. So you have to pass internal and preliminary exams to appear in final university exams. 
The difficulty level of internal and preliminary exams are slightly high than university exams.
The mp shah medical college comes under Saurashtra University."

Teaching method includes they explained any topic in bilingual and deeply for easy understanding by students and same at the time of practical.
There was similar as all engineering courses, 8-semester exams which have a duration of 6 months each including 3 internal exams in every semester and viva for each semester too.

Ramesh,NRI Institute of Technology - [NRIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0,NRIIT- Review,"Hands-on job experience.

The best way to learn is by doing. An internship provides the opportunity to not just apply classroom learning to the real world, but gain practical skills as well.

Meaningful connections.

Many jobs are obtained through connections. Internships provide networking opportunities and ways to meet people who can serve as mentors.

An opportunity to “test drive” a career.

Ideally, an internship will provide a taste of a particular job, which can help a student decide if that’s the right career path for them. If not, there’s often still plenty of time to make changes.

Excellent resume boost.

A great internship helps any resume, especially if it provides a student with hands-on experience in their field. It also serves as proof to employers that a graduate is serious about their chosen profession.

Help society.

Many students take internships with non-profits and other charitable organizations that provide beneficial services for a local community or society."

The best way to learn is by doing. An internship provides the opportunity to not just apply classroom learning to the real world, but gain practical skills as well.

Meaningful connections.

Many jobs are obtained through connections. Internships provide networking opportunities and ways to meet people who can serve as mentors.

An opportunity to “test drive” a career.

Ideally, an internship will provide a taste of a particular job, which can help a student decide if that’s the right career path for them. If not, there’s often still plenty of time to make changes.

Excellent resume boost.

A great internship helps any resume, especially if it provides a student with hands-on experience in their field. It also serves as proof to employers that a graduate is serious about their chosen profession.

Help society.

Many students take internships with non-profits and other charitable organizations that provide beneficial services for a local community or society."
