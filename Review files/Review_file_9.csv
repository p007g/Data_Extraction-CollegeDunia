Deeksha Relhan,Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology - [MIET],"M.C.A {Lateral},",7.0,College Era 2022,"The fee structure is not quite suitable for all. It is a 2-year program whose fee was 22000 for both the year which doesn't include exam fees and registration fees. For every time you give the exam, you have to register with 7000 per year. It's AKTU university exam registration fees. I basically didn't like the study because old technologies were used, no such good examples for better understanding basically I didn't get much interest in studies. Also, 1 year went in COVID another year it calmly went on. No feel of college life in anyways. So it is expensive as per the seeing the hospitality, maintenance and quality of the study. Financial assistance was also in a small cabinet area where is a big line in which we have to wait for so long to ask any query or even during the fee submission. Also, it is the ground area which in summer makes it unbeatable to stand alone. They are also not cooperative and not well accountants they took a lot of time to process things and little less manner to behave during sometime",

Getting about the faculty-student ratio, I don't think it is an issue because a good faculty can teach thousands of students, if and only if he/she can connect with them.
One thing I would recommend or will urge the government is that all the faculty in engineering colleges should at least ask to get a diploma or bachelor's degree in education. Because all the faculty in the engineering colleges are engineers and none of the engineering students would like to be a teacher after completing the engineering courses. So the faculty in the engineering colleges are left from their jobs or may have several reasons and then they come to teach not by passion but because of the need, and they have been given the string which would rule the country's future.
