Most of the subjects were advanced versions of the majority of subjects one would learn in the undergraduate curriculum.  Before joining I aimed at specializing in the Process design area of Chemical Engineering, however, the course was very robust with advanced versions of main topics like Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer, and Reaction Engineering.  The biggest highlight was the faculty who taught the courses. Subjects were taken by Distinguished Faculties from IITs and the mode of instruction was way different from conventional techniques. This made the overall learning experience great. Also, summer courses on special Chemical Engineering software were provided at the end of the first semester.
