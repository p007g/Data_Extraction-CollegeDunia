At the time of admission, the first one was the one that I could get into based on my marks and rank. Both the courses have the same course material taught, only the latter has more students admitted and thus has more competition amongst peers. Every branch is divided into batches of 60 students approx. for lectures and 30 for labs, each having one teaching staff which makes the faculty: student ratio pretty good. The exams in Thapar are divided into sessional and mid term and final term exam. Before each term exam you have a sessional exam/quiz for each subject taught and a lab evaluation(which is counted into sessional exam) if the subject has practical credits. So the exams happen very frequently and is relatively easy to pass if you perform average in every test but the term exams are still moderately difficult.",8.3/10

It's not quite enough as students can’t ask teachers about his/her doubts comfortably. Although teachers give their best to solve the problems of students. They even provide materials so it makes work easy. About examination, it's best at its place and yes it's easy to pass if prepared well. They conduct two internal exams and one external main per semester. But one thing is that sometimes we can’t use our own language in theory exams.
