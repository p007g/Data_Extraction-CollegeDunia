Student ratio: the student ratio of my department is more towards the boy side, i.e. if a class has 40 boys then there would be 20 girls. 
For each year there will be 2 semesters, and each semester has mid-semester exams and end-semester exams. So overall in a year, you will have two mid-sem and two end-sem.
