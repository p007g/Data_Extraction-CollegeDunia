The college follows a standard protocol for applying to companies wherein, the student is allowed to attend an interview if his/her profile is shortlisted by the Company for their further rounds. Almost 100% of the batch gets placed every year unless students opt out of the placement cycle or remain unplaced for other disciplinary reasons.

According to the requisites of questions I opted for this course because I am a UPSC aspirant and this course in my opinion will help me in this Exam. 
Student teacher ratio in my own class is very poor reaching a staggering 1:127.
