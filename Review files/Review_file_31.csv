Soumya Rai,Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College - [ARSD],"B.Sc {Hons.}, Physics",8.0,"Great Campus life, supportive teachers , Overall amazing experience!","I chose Physics since I had an interest in the subject and there are more career opportunities in this field. The course curriculum for Physics Hons is very balanced and it contains almost all the important topics, We also have practicals and Coding. Everything will help you even in your master's. The student-teacher ratio is 15:1. Almost all the teachers are a doctorate and the rest are post-graduated. Many of them teach well and make every topic clear but few of the teachers need to focus on practical implications rather than just making students memorize theory. In coding classes, they need to teach the basics of code but rather they make us learn codes by ourselves. Internals are taken after 2 months which is fair enough and easy to pass. End sem exams are also good. DU is easy to pass if you study sincerely at least 15 days before the exam.",

The faculty students are around 20:1 and the ratio even becomes better if we include the PhD scholars under this. We get to interact with them and they are of helpful attitude. Each and every faculty is a PhD holder in their respective streams. Teaching methods vary among them. Few of the just come and talk and we note the important points down. Many of them come with some slides and presentations and explain the topic according to the points mentioned in the slides, which I think is the best method of teaching. Exams happen in time. The syllabus and classes are planned accordingly. The difficulty level of the paper is not that much. If the student has attended all the classes, he/she can score well in the examination. In a nutshell, the questions don't come out of what is being taught in the class. This motivates us to be regular.",
