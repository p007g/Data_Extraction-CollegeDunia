Piyush Kumar,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],,7.8,NIT RAIPUR-A GOOD CHOICE,"The normal cost to study will be around 7-7.5 lac in NIT Raipur, but for those students whose family annual income is between 1 to 5 lac, it will cost you around 4 lac only and for those having below 1 lac per annum, the fee will not be more than 2 lac for all 4 years. (Fees are mentioned including hostel fees).

But if you want more relaxation in fees then you can apply for an education loan in banks. Banks provide scholar loan schemes for students admitted in IITs/NITs/IIITs/IIMs. Then, you don't have to pay any fees and if you have paid any you will get refunded. Since it is a loan so you have to repay it, the benefit is that your parents don't need to pay for it. You get a good placement and repay your loan.

For scholarships, there are many options like the one provided by state governments, NSP Scholarship, FEE Scholarship, Dr. KK Sugandhi Scholarship, and a lot more. After getting admission you will get to know about all scholarships on the college's website.",

Ujjwal Pandey,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",9.2,KIIT is one of the best college for placements,"One can easily score 9 CGPA if you just go through the all PPTs before the exams. here the course is quite easy, and getting good marks is a very common thing here.
they teach very less, it is your duty to complete it. Cause if youâre preparing for GATE/ ISRO/ DRDO or even placement, then you need to have a good grasp of the core subjects.
I am not saying that the course is bad, but, what they will do, they will teach you how to write the symbol of integration on paper, the rest you have to learn by yourself.
Here, KIIT played a masterstroke, by allotting all the good professors to the first-year students. Most of the professors who teach the senior students, are either doing research in some field or are engaged in some other activities.
Here the faculties, i.e. the lab assistants, most of them have a very basic knowledge about the subjects.  Never argue with them. Neither with professors. You never know, a single argument might ruin your career.",
