Some of the teachers like Nishant Sir, Renu Mam, etc., were humble and polite yet disciplined the students aptly also I liked their teaching pattern as they cleared the concepts before moving ahead and made us practice as many questions as possible.

I wanted to be on the right career path. As far as the course curriculum goes, it is not so different from any other top-notch college. The faculty members are highly qualified. However, owing to the huge no of students in college if you want to do research work or ask any doubt, you need to do it yourself.  Almost 3000 kids are in the CS building. Branches are CSE, IT, CSSE, and CSCE. Regarding exams the college is very strict, you need to study all year long if you want to maintain a cgpa of 9 and above. 155 credits to be completed in 4 years. 3rd year is the most crucial year in college if you want to land yourself at a top company.",
