I feel Faculty:student ratio is appropriate, Professors are available any time students try to reach them, whether it is professional advice or academic advice. Faculties are very highly qualified, almost all the professors have a PhD from internationally reputed universities along with significant post-doc experience. For first year courses(common courses for every department), faculty:student ratio is very low.

The TAs help the student in their course-related problems during weekly sessions. Overall, the learning experience is not so great for 1st year courses due to many factors- Large batch size during instruction, lack of clarity in instruction and performance-oriented atmosphere particularly intense during the 1st year. In the subsequent years the quality of teaching improves drastically as the students take up the courses in their respective departments. Curriculum and the course content is still a bit outdated, but recently the focus on practical training has improved greatly.

Teachers are qualified but some of them don't know how to interact with students which is why the ratio of attendance is 15 out of 42. No student wants to come to the college because the classes are not at all interactive. Now, if I discuss about the exams then they came from the university so no matter if the teacher is interested in teaching or she cares about the student's lacking areas or not but we have to study as per the syllabus on our own.",
