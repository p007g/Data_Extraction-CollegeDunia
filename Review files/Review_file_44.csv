I would say it will take 3-4 years for the college to get good placement statistics as its alumni network matures. The college does not appear in the NIRF ranking yet and will take 2-3 years for that. The lack of NIRF ranking hinders companies from visiting campus and qualifies it as tier 3 college hence the poor placement yet few students get good off-campus placement in companies like DE Shaw, Google, CISCO, PayPal, Microsoft. The marking is very strict as the college follows relative marking. If you do not get a good GPA in the first year you are almost doomed for the rest.",4.0/10

: There are Enough faculty to solve any problem realted with their academics but they are not interested in your activities outside your classroom. The ratio is 1:40

: The faculties are well educated and have M.tech degree holders so they have the idea to explain the topics properly but the only bad thing is they not try again if someone not follows them in first explanation.

: There are two internal and one external exams are taken every semester in which internal exams are taken after every two months which is organised by college and the external exam is taken at the last of semester which is organised by the Board Jharkhand University of technology.

The college provides a specific time to the students to submit the fee of the college. The annual fee of the college is 70000 and can be increased as the year grow. One thing that disappointed me is taking the exam fee. After paying the college fee (70000) the students also have to pay the exam fees to the college to seat in the exam, and the fee is around 1600 for one semester. Another Disappointment is scholarship the college also focuses on the expenses there is no proper I formation about the scholarship in the college. Only a few students are able to gain the scholarship in the college who fill the form. And the rest of the students are left blank. There are no jobs from the college side as the college is mainly focused on study. They provide the placement but not the internship and the stipend which was very bad. The college provides the courses on some websites which are paid courses and some are free but they are sponsored, and not good.",8.0/10

Nikhil kumar,Acharya Narendra Dev College - [ANDC],"B.Sc, Life Sciences",,ANDC is good place to study,"I had chosen the B.Sc Life Science course because it includes maximum subjects like Botany, Zoology, Chemistry, Environmental Studies, English, etc so I got exposure to every subject and it was very interesting. 
Talking about the faculty of ANDC, the teachers were well qualified, educated, and experienced. Frankly talking they are very good And there was enough teacher in the college compared to students. The term exams were held regularly every six months and they were not very hard to pass. 
But one thing which I want should improve is that at the time of selection of subjects from optional one, we didn't get the many choices as our class strength was low.",7.4/10
