Shivani a,Jamshedpur Women's College,"BCA, General",6.6,,Course and curriculum is good but there is a lack of faculty in BCA department due to which it becomes difficult for students to learn and get the correct amount of knowledge. students amount in one class is 45 to 50. teaching methods are also not satisfied. exams and semester were taken on time. the exams were not that difficult to pass. I personally didn't like the teaching methods. less exposure to upcoming technology and innovation. if you are good at self study then you are good to go. fee structure was considerably less.,

The faculty is good and helpful . Mostly in 1st and 2nd year the faculty are people who have just graduated from the same College. Few faculty members are from premium colleges and have atleast masters in qualification . But many are of age 20-24 who have just completed their engineering. Since the college is affiliated to RTU the syllabus and also the books are standardized to some extent. Faculty is also specific to the topics that can come in the university exams . Use of standard books and books from popular writers are very rare . Faculty and seniors always recommend to study from RTU books only. Local books of NK publications , genius publication etc are given preference. Term exam schedule was decided by the university and was extremely difficult to pass. Results in RTU come 5-6 months after the exams. Always majority of people have questioned the authenticity of the marking and result.",

Student (Anonymous),Budge Budge Institute of Technology - [BBIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.0,"Good College and a little Expensive - [BBIT], Kolkata","Social life is awesome at BBIT if you are an extrovert. The College organizes multiple events every year, like freshers, competitions parties, concerts, and many more. In the previous two years before covid lockdown once Badsha and once Honey Singh came for the concerts.

Along with the enjoyment the main thing study is enforced here. You will get all your books from the library for the entire semester to study, and also extra books are available other than the syllabus for study and also newspapers to read over there. Just stay quiet in the library.

Classrooms are pretty good and large enough to hold all the students in a class. In most cases, benches are empty for obvious not 100% attendance.

If you are living in the hostel then you can be a part of different activities but your study might hamper due to no extra time for curriculum activities. Playing grounds are there, like football, basketball, and cricket. Also, the seminar hall was empty for dance and other activities. Just you need permission for these.",

Books are there in library but librarian is very bad. Many boys have to face problems while taking books from library. 
Sports are good but not in that way. If you are a good player of any game then the sports team will induct you otherwise if you want to learn any game there is no space for you.

Vaibhav Vats,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology University - [JIIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.4,Opportunities in JIIT(in 2021),"The life at campus is what you make if it, there is enough going on in the campus like festivals, seminars, coding events, etc that will keep you busy. The library is decent but students mostly just use it as a quiet place for studying. It doesn't have lakhs of books. First year is the prime time for taking part in different festivals, coding groups, electronics groups or enjoy the Noida lifestyle full of restaurants and clubs. Being in the middle of Noida is the biggest strength and weakness. Due to being in Noida college campus isn't very expensive, there is a cemented football, basketball ground and a garden (not for playing) and that's about it due to the shy high rent of land in Noida. But being in the middle of one of India's most developed parts means easy access to every food item you can think of, every thing can be delivered to you, grocery can be delivered within 2 hours from Amazon and you feel connected unlike a lot of colleges with giant campuses but in a desolate area. There are a lot of companies right besides the college, my roommate got an internship in one of those. Infrastructure is new and very well maintained, really well maintained. There's a metro station right in front of the college that gives access to every corner of Delhi ncr, we used it to go on many trips across Delhi. Just buy a metro card and travel is seamless and air conditioned.So overall if you an outgoing person, this is literally the best you can get in terms of college location. If you don't go out, delivery on you doorstep is best and fastest anywhere in India. The college doesnt have as many activities as say an IIT, and don't expect superstars on the campus for the festivals either.",

As per the counselling from CET, you choose the college using the code mentioned in the online process, later you arrive at the college at the given time slot and date. Pay the college fee (?â_55321) for 1st year by hard cash or Demand draft. Your admission is confirmed. The above procedure is for aided seats and unaided seats (fee is different). For management seats, you?Ûªll have to enquire at the main office (located inside the university). One of the main reasons for preferring this college over the others is the placements. The placement training starts during the 3rd year and recruitment?Ûªs starts at the beginning of 4th year. It has proved 100% placements every year. Though the placements are 100% for only CS and ECE branches, other branches also get ample number of recruiters compared to other colleges.

Priya Singh,IIT Mandi- Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],,6.7,,"I feel like in my college, CSE was always treated like the cream of the BTech and the professors were nice. But our common courses were very boring and unnecessary, thankfully they have been reduced to a minimum. The faculty to student ratio depends on the class size of the subject but for the first year the whole batch will study in same classes and after that it's mostly like 70 students or so per class. The teaching method was more or less the same, with ppts and demos and assignments. We never had a problem with exam not being held on time. I think the first two years were easy to pass but I regret not getting better grades because the rest two years got hard for me. Specially my core courses as I started losing interest in CSE, I found it hard to keep up and it made my CGPA dip. But I never let it dip less than 7, which is essential since you need that for placements. And passing is easy. If you don't get too distracted. Even if you only give assignments and mess up your exams. You'll still pass.",

Shyam Gupta,KIET Group of Institutions - [KIET],"B.Tech, Computer Science And Information Technology",8.0,Taking KIET college is good decision or not.,I chose Computer science and information technology because I saw the syllabus and found that it was the same as the CSE branch. There are 25 students per faculty member. Most of the teachers are postgraduate(MTECH) from the NITs and some have (30-40 faculty) doctorate degree in their respective subjects. Faculties are too much friendly and always ready to teach. Their teaching methods are too good but some have more knowledge but are not able to teach effectively. Overall the faculties are too good and cooperative. The term exams are quite tough but if you have taken the class seriously then u can pass the exam easily.,

The average package from almost all IT companies will be 3.5 LPA as of now. As we all know that, only a few or no core companies will be visiting the college.
