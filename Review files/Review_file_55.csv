Sourav Das,Scottish Church College,"B.Sc {Hons.}, Physics",8.1,Best college in kolkata to become graduate,"Scottish Church College is the oldest college in Kolkata (established in 1830). For physics, this is one of the best colleges affiliated with the University of Calcutta. I gave the entrance exam of physics in 2018, and it was my dream to study in this college. I never thought that I will get admission here, but I was lucky to be selected here. The entrance exam was conducted for Physics only. Other departments select students on the basis of Merit only. But the physics entrance was stripped-off in 2019 by college authorities, citing economic reasons, despite resistance against this decision by the physics faculty, after which, the Department of Physics also has to select students based on the board exam's merit only.The physics faculty is very nice, and have understanding professors, who try to help any student even in their personal problems. The environment of the college is also the best in Kolkata. This college is a site for cultural heritage. Freedom fighter, Shri Subhash Chandra Bose, spiritual monk Swami Vivekananda, ISKCON founder, Swami Prabhupada, all studied here, and the list goes on. Department of Physics also has two dedicated computer labs only for physics students, for computer programming, and two different laboratories for physics experiments. Everything about this college is good, but it seems that the college authorities do not release much-required funding on time. Apart from these, the college and the department separately take time to time anonymous feedback from the students, and I have noticed that they act accordingly on the feedback to improve the downsides. From this year, the physics department has started a bi-weekly career and entrance exam-oriented course for the students.",

Even though I gave my JEE Advance I couldn't get a mechanical engineering seat in top IIT's hence, I utilized my JEE Mains rank for joining NITT. Mechanical Engineering was in my mind and additionally due to home state quota I got the seat quite comfortably in the JOSAA counselling. While the pandemic affected all sectors, I feel many of my peers including myself lost interest in studying as exam dates were continuously delayed and extended. This was the reason I couldn't score enough in JEE Advance. I contacted a few seniors and various websites such as collegedunia.com and siksha.com for the reviews of NITT before JOSAA started. One of the most discussed thing on the internet was that sometimes few professors were not up to the mark. This made me think about my decision for sometime but I realized that self study is more important in college life. The alumni network of NITT is vast with some big names such as Mr. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Mr. K.R. Sridhar, Mr. Palanivel Thiagarajan, etc. Moreover, the club culture in NITT is exceptional where we get to learn and reciprocate granting us excellent exposure. I can assure the quality of clubs since I'm a part of a few clubs myself and it was very interesting even though things were online.

Aditionally IITG is second in India in terms of citations/faculty. So clearly, the faculty here is highly competent. Needless to say their teaching methods are exceptional, and that is my review just from an online perspective. One would guess that their offline method of teaching must be just mind-blowing.  Exams held in my college is pretty tough, as in there is no direct solution which can be found in any book or online.

Sidharth Bhawani,Model Institute of Engineering and Technology - [MIET],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.8,B.E CSE @MIET Jammu [Review by 1st year(2nd Sem) student],"I chose this college over others because I was not able to clear JEE mains exam and didn't got any college outside Jammu so I decided to go for JKCET and do my engineering in my own city. And the another reason was the faculty of MIET Jammu. Specially in my CSE department the professors are excellent and highly qualified. They will do everything to provide the best things to their students. Students should also try to give the best if the professors are working on for their betterment of the future. Here, only one who strive for success or is ready to face any challenge and want to keep learning and grow with time can achieve best things in his/her life. In this college if anyone tries to underestimate his/her skills or if the person will not make sufficient efforts to learn something new then he/she will not be successful and end up just complaining about the college.The bad aspect of this college is that you will not get too much like minded students. In my batch there are very less number of students who are serious about their career. But it's all about time. They might get awakened one day and work on for the betterment of their future. Another thing is that the placements are not so good. The highest package offered in 2021 was 13 LPA and only service based companies like-TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc visit for campus placements.Lastly I want to say that if anyone want to do CSE from Jammu after giving the JKCET examination then this college is best because after completing the engineering the college will assist you for higher studies and you can go for higher studies in US or any other country or even prepare for GATE to get job in PSU or do M-TECH/M.S from IIT/NIT or IISC or any other top college of India.

Mayank rawat,Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College - [ARSD],"BA {Hons.}, Political Science",5.4,"College opening - [ARSD], New Delhi","Sorry, but the higher authorities didn't open the College for us. I don't know anything. So better open the Colleges or otherwise I will protest against you. The online library is not available.  Please open the Colleges then I will see my classroom, my friends, teachers, sports ground, College gate, and guard. There are a number of sports like badminton, football, basketball, and cricket.  I didn't take part in any society because those are social groups and when I have to make social distancing then there is no use of it. Beware of the college students and open the Colleges for everyone because if any 3 waves came and delayed the opening of College then it will be very bad for you.",
AASHISH PADVETNAYA UR,TAPMI Manipal,,7.6,TAPMI unbiased review,Campus placement applies from the 2nd year. Internship opportunities are there right from the 2nd month of joining. The number of companies visiting the campus is 100+ and the average package is about 11.5L. We have a 100% placement record and it is not bloated. You can take a look at the TAPMI placement record and everything is very transparent. That is one of the best things about TAPMI. The only drawback is that marketing companies are less and all are sales oriented.,
