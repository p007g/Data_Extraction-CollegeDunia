Shubham Singh Parihar,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,LPU land of opportunities.,I choose this course for my passion for computer science. Lpu promises various exposure and opportunities which no other college provides. The student: faculty ratio is about 30: 1 which is very impressive. All faculties are phd holders with 5 to 10 years of prior teaching experience. Term exams were held in every 3 months and the difficulty of exams in moderate.,
Al Zaid,Integral University,"B.Tech, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence",6.7,Good for study bad for enjoyment,"I choose this course cause I wanted to be a software Engineer. 
Yeah, the faculty is very vast as well as the number of students in most of the courses. They have only 500 seats for CSE and when it's filled they stop taking admission to BTech CSE.
More than 80 per cent of faculty teachers are PhD or at least masters 
Their teaching methods are the very best. We get classes regularly very few classes are left unattended by the teacher. 
 This is the worst part of this University we get long holidays after semesters and when it times to examinations everything happens in a very less period of time. For examination, assignment, quizzes, viva, practicals and students doesn't get enough time to prepare in mid sem. We don't even get one day gap between examinations and sometimes 2 exams in a day most student loses marks because of this issue. Our examination is also very hard it's very hard to even pass through exams in the teachers don't even help while the examination",

There was just a small stage and a shade that could hardly cover 20-30 students. All the other students were standing in the sunlight.
There is nothing like refreshments provided in any fest, not even the paid ones. All the other fests are held in the same manner.
The availability of books and journals in the Library is also not good.
Also, the classroom amenities are worse. There are no good fans in the classroom, even in the computer labs, the ac is always off and the teachers don't even bother to switch on the ac in summer too.
There are some extracurricular activities but they are not the ones you would love to take part in. There are some social clubs run by the students on their own.",
