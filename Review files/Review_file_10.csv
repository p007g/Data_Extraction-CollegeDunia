Dhabas and Canteen culture is pretty unique to JNU, along with its intellectual talk sessions. Aerated drinks are banned on campus which kind of makes me sad.

The faculty-student ratio was not bad as it was 1:68 which is decent as the number of students is quite high. Putting the numbers aside it was not difficult to approach the teacher for any clarification as the faculty is friendly and understanding. Most of the faculties are highly educated in their field and had experiences in other colleges. The term exam was about every 4-5 months for me as a new education policy was introduced but the CTs or you can say the exams which contributed to internal exams were every 15 days. The difficulty level is not very high or very low. It depended on how much you have prepared for the exam. The passing criteria were also median as it requires you to get 50 per cent of marks in every subject including internal and external marks. The internal marks contributed 60 per cent and external marks contributed 40 per cent.,

All the faculties are qualified with masters and honors in their branch, some are even dietitians and nations, the teaching method is a little boring to be honest, anyways you have to study on your own at the end.
There are 3 exams in total, CAT 1, CAT 2, and FAT(the final exam for the semester). Every exam has around a 1-month gap, so you gotta be quick and keep all the syllabus completed.
