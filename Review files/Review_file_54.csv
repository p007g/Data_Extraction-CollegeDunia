Student (Anonymous),Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.3,Life of vitian,"A student with a rank of less than 20k would pay a tuition fee of 1.6 lacs per year, followed by a hostel fee of approximately (on average) 65k per year, depending on your mess caterer and room type (AC/NonAC/Number of roommates). So your college fees will be around 2.3 lacs per year, for a total of 9.2 lacs for four years, including hostel and tuition fees. The remainder will be determined by your pocket money and how much you spend on other things. So, if you choose a 4 bedded non-ac room and a decent mess, the annual rates will be 22000 and 43000, respectively, and 65000 is about the cheapest amount that you will pay for hostel fees.

The faculty-student ratio is not that good. You will get one teacher in a class of 70 students. But yes you will get your personal mentor that will help you out in every way they can. You can reach out to them whenever you need any help. The faculties are somehow highly trained. Some are young as well. They complete their masters or PhD from there only. They will teach you very well if you cooperate with them. Although mid-semester exams were MCQ-based so it's easy to clear and end-semester exams are 50-50 means half part is of MCQ and the other half Theory. The same applies to your practice.,

SUMAN GARAI,Ramkrishna Mahato Government Engineering College,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.0,Honest Review of my College,"I had chosen Cse because I was always enthusiastic about coding since my 10th standard so I decided to make my career in this itself.There are 30-35 teachers in this college and students are around 1200 so faculty: student ratio is very low.So you have to be very disciplined and hardworking if you choose this college because the teacher does not have time to take classes and you have to complete the bulk of the syllabus on your own. The teachers here are highly qualified and their teaching method is also up to the mark. There are four internal exams altogether one every month and two practicals in middle and before the end of the semester. It is not difficult to pass if you are sincere and dedicated to your studies but as I mentioned earlier that as the number of teachers is very less so they are not able to take your class regularly.In that case, you have to plan yourself accordingly and start studying hard and don't keep anything pending at last week before your semester exam.",

Generally, no scholarships are offered as it is a goverment college, and also I don't think so that loans are needed as fees are not so high. In an internship, an intern will get INR 15000 per month, so in one year of internship, you can earn INR 1,80,000. The average salary of MBBS in the goverment sector is 45,000-50,000 per month and in the private sector, their salary will be 25,000-29000 per month. Good network at government medical colleges and hospitals. But they are not offering you a scholarship on the basis of your marks. But you may apply for scholarships under many schemes of the goverment ( e- portal scholarship government of Punjab ) if you are belonging to a category then you also may apply for it and get your scholarship. The internship will be for one year at the hospital through which you can earn a stipend of at least INR 15000 per month. After PG if u ger job then u can earn more than 70,000 per month in a goverment job and in a private job +50.",
