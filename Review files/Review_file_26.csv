Many companies which come to college often place some cut-off criteria for the written round. Normally high paying companies which come early for placements put criteria of 8CGPA. Since you are still in 3rd year, you have a great chance to improve your CG in these 2-3 upcoming semesters.
CS branch is very generous in giving grades in latter semesters, so keep attending classes or reading class notes which will help in improving your CGPA. The first and foremost step is to decide which type of company you want to get placed in. I'm pretty sure you are looking to get placed in core product development companies like Microsoft, Amazon, De Shaw, Informatica, etc.
My answer will be for these companies only, but I'm sure it will help in cracking other less hard tech interviews like that of Samsung, 
Or it's not a fixed salary or marks you got  If you have more than
80percentent overall - Then you can sit in placements of Google, Microsoft and big companies more than 70–75 u can get medium-level companies about 7 lakh package if you have between 60–70u can only get max 3.5 lakh package and you end up up in mass recruiter",9.1/10
