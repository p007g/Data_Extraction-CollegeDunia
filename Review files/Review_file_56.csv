Faculties include professionals with work experience in multiple industries and rich in academics. The faculty student ratio at TAPMI is 1:9.

Manash kumar,Chhotu Ram Polytechnic,"Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",6.7,Detailed review of the college,"First I wanted to choose the automobile engineering but this branch was un available in the college so after that I asked from some persons which branch do I choose . After getting suggestions from many friends I ended up choosing mechanical engineering branch . 
In this branch there are about 70 students in my class . 
I think faculties are well qualified for this job and the teachings method of the teacher are good . 
The board conducts exam like internal exams before semester exam . Board takes 3 seasonal exams before the semester examination so that the students get prepared for the semester examination,  this helps students to pass in their exams but still some students are not able to get passed in the semester examination due to lack of their concentration in classroom and in their studies too",

Now comes the question, how they teach. Honestly speaking, every teacher is not that good at dealing with the students. Some teachers are very helpful. They provide their free time also to the students who ask for it. But on the contrary, some are really rude. They just care about the assignments and their syllabus.

Sourav kumar Rana,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT-K],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.6,Honest review IIIT KOTA,"How is life in IIIT Kota?Discalimer : Before you read my answer i would like you to know that all these views are my own. These views are based on my experiences of the past two years plus the current ongoing year in IIIT KOTA. With these views i dont intend to hurt the sentiments of any individual (specially our faculty) or group. I just want to give all the bright students out there looking for a college to get admission into, an unbiased view of this college. Also this is my answer for the ongoing year of 2017.Hi. I am a student in 3rd year of IIIT KOTA. I think that the answer to this question will keep on changing with time. But for now and some of the next upcoming years, most of what i have written next will remain the same:Education:-In terms of education this institute is just like any other institute. Few teachers are good and many teachers are bad. Plus there are only a few core teachers who have been teaching for the past few years in IIIT. But every year guest faculties come to teach us. Many of those teachers are young and inexperienced in terms of teaching. Some of them have to teach us subjects that they themselves are coming across for the first time in their life. So you will have to bear with that every year. On the plus side our curriculum is a bit flexible. As we can ask our course coordinator to change any unimportant elective subject to one that is more beneficial to us (no guarantee that it will be changed but there is a possibility that it might be changed). But in the end you will have to study on your own and work very hard if you really want to gain in terms of knowledge.Facilities & Life :-In terms of facilities, any new batch is paying around 8 lakhs for 4 years plus hostel fees and this is comparable with the fees of any good private college. So the factor that the fees of a govt college is less is not true any more. Plus i think that for a fees of 8+ lakhs you are not getting as many facilities as you would in any private college. The classrooms and labs are good enough. There are issues if you want to be a part of a sports team of MNIT as they dont allow anyone of IIIT KOTA in their teams. So you can join IIIT KOTA teams but the opportunities will be very less as compared to MNIT. The mess food is okay-okay. For boys the hostel rooms and bathrooms are pathetic. There are many issues with net in hostel as well, like very slow speed and no connectiivity are common. Also each year there is a chance that IIIT KOTA students will not be allowed to stay in MNIT hostels anymore due to lack of capacity. So if we get shifted outside of MNIT we will face many other problems as well. Girls are already not staying in hostels. They have been shifted to flats that have been constructed for faculties. Since the flats have been very recently constructed there are no net facilities over there. Also mobile network is very poor. Beds are not allowed so girls have to sleep with mattresses on the floor. The flats are 3 bhk. So each room is shared by 3 girls. Also the mess and the college is quite far from there. Even for internet they have to come to computer centre which is very far.There is no ragging here. Plus your seniors will be very helpful to you. If you have any queries or doubts or need any kind of help you can approach them anytime.Placements :-Apart from this in terms of placements i would say that if you have a dream of joining a good company after college, its best that you dont come here. Because there is no guarantee that companies will come for your batch or not. Each year we will have to struggle to call companies. We are at the mercy of MNIT. We are only allowed to sit in placements if MNIT allows us to. And in the end if MNIT says no. Nobody can do anything about it and the IIIT authorities will just say that they are really sorry but nothing can be done now and send you back. So i would recommend that if you want stability in terms of placements consider going to some other college, even private if possible. Since our batch is the first to have students of ECE. So no one knows what will happen to students of ECE next year and if they will even have a chance of sitting in a company or not.Also right now we are in MNIT Campus. As soon as we get shifted to KOTA there will be even less or no opportunities for placements as our college is quite new and so we don't have the required database of companies that we can call for placements. Till now no one knows when we will be shifted but with each passing year the probability increases.Yeah but if you want to go for further studies, then this college is fine for you.",

Riya,Meerut College,,8.1,Overall insights of Meerut college,"Okay so I'm gonna give you a detailed description of my admission procedure. As I decided to pursue M.Sc Computer Science from my home town only, I needed to apply for admission by registering myself in the university i.e. Choudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut. Few days after registration, first merit was released and I was selected there and then. I got a call from my college i.e. Meerut College and I went for the admission. I was really skeptical about it in the first place because this college was renowned for its political culture and bad people driven environment especially for girls. But still I decided to go further. I still remember my first day in the college was on 10/08/2018. As I entered the college and went to my department, I was relieved to see that our department (Department of Professional Courses) was entirely separate from all other traditional departments. Since Meerut College is really ancient (estb.1892), it doesn't have the modern infrastructure and gives the feel of that really old colleges. But my department (as it's newly built) was somewhat better than the rest. Hereby I'll mention the pros and cons of my total experience of 2 years in the college.
Pros:
1. Teachers are really qualified.
2. Regardless the strength of the class, classes were held regularly. 3. Entire course was completed by the teachers before the exams and also good notes were given.
4. Seniors were helpful in giving notes and previous year question papers.
5. Scholarships were given to almost every student who applied for it through UP Scholarship and Fee Reimbursement Scheme.
Cons:
1. No extra curricular activities like games, annual events, freshers and farewell parties, etc.
2. No modern infrastructure like ACs, well-built washrooms, canteen, etc.
3. Out of the strength of 38, max 10 students came to college regularly.

2. The department is allotted 76 seats for MBA, but every year around 40 people take admission. The remaining 36 seats fall vacant.
3. Some of the faculty members are very qualified and their teaching quality is satisfactory.
4. But the main problem for the students is: The system of ""Anonymous grading"" or ""Blind Grading"" is not followed by NITW. ""blind grading"" means masking or hiding a student`s name/roll number when correcting answer paper, done to prevent bias while correcting of answer paper by the faculty. This ""Blind grading"" system is practiced by many Central, Private, State universities, B Schools in India and even International Universities. But this practice is not followed in the School of Management, as a result, there is partiality incorrect answer papers and grading. Even when the correct answer is written, the marks are not awarded to some students. As a result, students are at a severe loss.",
