The faculty: student ratio is about 1: 60 which is not that good.
When we talk about the faculty, so the most of faculty staff is on a guest basis i.e there is a shortage of permanent professors in the university. The teaching method varies from faculty to faculty, Some faculty was brilliant in their teaching method but most of them are average.
The course was divided into 8 semesters i.e 2 semesters annually. in a semester, there is 2 type of main exams Mid Semester and End Semester examination. Scoring in these exams was quite difficult i.e one can pass the exam easily but to score good marks there was a need for very much hard work.",

Many companies which come to college often place some cut-off criteria for the written round. Normally high paying companies which come early for placements put criteria of 8CGPA. Since you are still in 3rd year, you have a great chance to improve your CG in these 2-3 upcoming semesters.
CS branch is very generous in giving grades in latter semesters, so keep attending classes or reading class notes which will help in improving your CGPA. The first and foremost step is to decide which type of company you want to get placed in. I'm pretty sure you are looking to get placed in core product development companies like Microsoft, Amazon, De Shaw, Informatica, etc.
My answer will be for these companies only, but I'm sure it will help in cracking other less hard tech interviews like that of Samsung, 
Or it's not a fixed salary or marks you got  If you have more than

Three sem exams are conducted in one year and according to this, our degree will be complete in two years. So in the term exam, there are need to change. because in 4 sem exam, it's hard to cover the whole syllabus",
