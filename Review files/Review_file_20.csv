Kamal pathak,Regional Institute of Education - [RIE],"B.Sc + B.Ed,",8.4,Honest review,"The course curriculum is very fascinating as we are learning all about subjects plus education.
We getting taught about all the core and main subjects with all subjects we get in b.ed.
I have chosen this course because here I'm getting trained for b.sc and b.Ed at the same time in the same course duration.
If I was doing a b.sc and b.ed from other colleges then It would take 5 yrs of mine but here I'm getting done in 4 yrs in the same college.
The faculty-student ratio is very good as our zoology class has 55 students and 3 teachers hence, it is a very good ratio same with the other courses and subjects.
Faculties are well qualified as the college is govt aided hence profs. Are there for all subjects with their expertise in every subject?
Teaching methods are discussed in demonstration methods.
We have yearly 2 time internal exams and a final external exam with practicals. It is not very difficult to pass exams until you have studied a little.",

Student (Anonymous),IIT Bombay - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITB],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.8,"IIT Bombay offers you the best, but still has scope for improvement - which you can bring about! :)","The fee is modestly close to the? 2,00,000 per year for tuition fees, additionally you'll have to pay? 90,000 for the mess, hostel, sports, hospital and other facilities for an entire year. Hence, the total fee for a year is closer to the? 2,90,000. 
It might seem huge, but you'll not have to pay a penny outside this and you'll get all the services at IIT Bombay included in this itself. Normally free revision is done by a separate committee every year, and it is as per the policies which are quite legitimate. I did not receive any scholarships as they are only given to students from economically weaker sections and there are provisions for such scholarships. Students whose family income is less than ? 8,00,000 and whose CPI>6.0 are not required to pay tuition fees under Merit-Cum-Means Scholarship. The full fee is waived for students with less than ? 5,00,000 income.

Instead of these subjects, other technical subjects could have been added such as Digital Design, Web Development, etc. I chose CSE because I love programming. Some of the faculty members are good while others are mediocre. There's not a studious environment in college. Out of 70 students, only 2-3 students are willing to study, others are for timepass. Teachers also are not concerned about students. The teaching style seems archaic. The biggest drawback is the attendance criteria of 75%, if you fail to fulfil this criterion, you get detained in internal exams. For each semester, there are two internal tests with a gap of around 1.5 months between them, and at the end of the semester, there are external semester exams.

Student (Anonymous),IIT Delhi - Indian Institute of Technology [IITD],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.8,IITD honest review,"I personally chose CS1 which is 4 years BTECH in Computer Science and Engineering because it was the best branch I was getting with my rank. The faculty-student ratio varies from class to class though on average in the first year it will be around 1:150. But from the second year onwards it will decrease. This is because, in the first year of IITD, all the branches have the same courses. Coming up o the part of academics in IITD, it's way different from JEE academia. One needs to give equal importance to labs and classes. Also to get good grades in IITD you should keep your jee mode on cause everything is relative to grading in IITD.

Fees hike is rare unless there is any inflation. Study cost is worth. Because what you get in your fees is completely worth it. 
You will find many scholarships like state and central government all scholarship is applicable to you. Including this, Industries like SAIL and some other releases their scholarship. You will get notified by the faculty members who are specially appointed to aware students about scholarship information. College claims that they will help you to get study loans but I recommend you to manage yourself for study loans if you need them.
Come to jobs, colleges provide campus joining where companies like TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, etc. recruit students. But my suggestion is, you always look for off-campus opportunities and don't worry about how to get to know about opportunities. You will automatically get to know if you have a strong friend zone.",
