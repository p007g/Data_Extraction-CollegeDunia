Ashwani Kumar Tiwari,Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology -[CSAUA&T],"MBA, Agribusiness",,"MBA Agri business:Fee, Scope and Future Opportunity","I choose the course of agribusiness because like after BSc in agriculture you can go for MSc in agriculture or MBA in agribusiness. I don't want to prepare for Ph.D. in the government sector so there is a better scope of an MBA in the private sector rather than an MSc in agriculture.
Another reason for doing MBA is placement. The placement ratio of MBA students is better than m.sc students and salaries are also good. Another reason is in the private sector and MBA degree holders will get better promotions than average MSc degree holders.
On my campus, there are 46 students in MBA agribusiness and 7 to 80% of them will surely get a minimum package of 350000 and a maximum package of 8 lacs.
The guest faculty of MBA agribusiness is quite good. There are some teachers who are not as good as others but there is a 100% guarantee of course completion.
