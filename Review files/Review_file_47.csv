So there are over 450+ students here. And in the 1st semester there are 12 subjects. And yes we have dedicated teacher for every subject but still there is a huge teacher student ratio like one teacher takes on around 150+ students. There are 3 section divided. And few teachers like english, Librarian hardly takes their class. 
All teachers here hold a PhD Degree but except 1 or 2 teacher no one teaches in English. Not even English teachers here speaks English properly. And Quality of teaching is not very good here. If teachers would study a topic and teach it to us...it would be very feasible for the students. But I think no teacher here in Agriculture is there to help any student.
No mid term exams were held in 2021 for bsc Ag and I think direct semester would occur. There are class test but ofcourse of no use.90% students here are of Hindi medium",2.7/10
