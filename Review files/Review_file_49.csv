Student (Anonymous),International Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Information Technology",,Expect everything from the college except internships and placements,"Courses are good and related to your allotted branch. The CS branches in the college(CSE, IT, CE) have almost similar courses.
Coming to the faculty, you have qualified professors, with MTech and PhDs, some from the IITs but they won't be teaching you all the courses, you will be getting assistant teachers(including MTech students) for half of your courses. Senior professors are well versed with their teaching and won't disappoint you, just following their lectures can get you good grades in your semester, but the assistant teachers are pathetic in their work. In my five-semester experience, I have been getting at least one or two such teachers each semester. They are irregular in taking classes, bad in their teaching ways, and don't even care. MTech students just take classes for the sake of a stipend. I would advise you to avoid such teachers, if possible.
We have a mid sem exam, 2 quizzes, and an end sem exam each semester. Exams are easy to pass for most subjects, previous year papers FTW.",4.8/10
