Mannkumar K Pandya,Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology - [SVIT] Vasad,"BE, Computer Engineering",9.3,REVIEW FOR A STUDENT BY A STUDENT   : D,"The campus is really 8/10.
what I mean is the college looks awesome, does not feels like you are in a 25 years old college and they are even also renovating the college, so good to go over there also.
going to the canteen, there are 5 different stalls including a NESCAFE which is the attraction amongst most of the students.
WE HAVE A LIBRARY, which lets you book on rent or can go there and read as much as you can; or take 3 books at home for 14 days during an exam or whenever needed.

also, we have a sports room over there, BUT U CANNOT BUNK AND GO THERE.",

Most of the faculties are either PhD or have done MBA from reputated MBA colleges, they all have a teaching experience of more than years. faculties here believe in teaching via interacting with students through activities, homework, etc. There were special PACT sessions organised once a week for acing in the GD/PI process of the companies. Talking about the exams there is end term exams, midterm exams and regular class tests, class presentations whose marks were incorporated in evaluating the final marks. The exams were not easy and to crack the exam one has to study hard throughout the year.",
