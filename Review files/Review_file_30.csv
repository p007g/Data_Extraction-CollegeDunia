But there are extra faculty for labs and in case some teacher is absent or left the college immediately. 
So approx ratio would be 1:50
The teachers are qualified and their teaching reviews are quite good they make students learn the course teachers don't encourage students to do extracurricular activities. Basically, in class, there is a school-type surrounding. But outside you can decide what u have to do. 
Exams are easy a student can easily pass the exam with one-day prior study to the exam.
