Keshav Gupta,Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology & Management - [ADGITM],"B.Tech, Civil Engineering",8.5,Review from Genuine POV,"The course curriculum is very good, as it has a syllabus that covered all the job exams but teaching is pretty average because the department doesn't have any planned process. About the faculty-student ratio, well there are 60 students per class. Faculty are either highly qualified or properly qualified to teach (Secret: some of them graduate from here and then get placed here to teach).  Exams are held very late and results released are even later thus giving problems to final year students for off-campus placements, for passing exams you need to get through with previous year papers (at least 3-4)(Either you will pass or you will top the exam depending on luck and writing skills).
Try answering in points as long as possible with a diagram if possible. Exams aren't much difficult to pass get Akash from anywhere or previous year's papers from the library. You have to study much on your own and not rely on faculties.",
