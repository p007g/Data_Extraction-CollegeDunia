Student (Anonymous),Assam Down Town University - [ADTU],"BA, Psychology",,"I would recommend this university, if you want to take psychology.","We have an annual fest called ""Attitude"", where various performers come from all over the world. It's usually held in an Amphitheater, where most of the students don't even fit in. Their planning of the university is quite poor. It was supposed to be a hospital but it made it into a university. 
They don't have any books on psychology in the library, so our faculties took the initiative to open a small library in the psychology lab. 
Only a few classes have projectors and a whiteboard. Most of the classes go with the traditional blackboard and chalks.  Sports are not given any priority and no information about clubs is given until the very end, and every club is run by teachers. So if a student wants to open a club, we can't even do that. We don't have any social groups or clubs or websites which are run by students.

The course is a good one as it lets you decide what career you want to get into, be it core or finance or IT. Talking about the faculty, they are very qualified and the ratio is also decent. But the faculty is kind of inhumane at many times where they just want to get over with the course. Many times I have felt that the professors think that students are at their mercy and act accordingly. This being said, it happens only sometimes. Much of the faculty is good and dedicated and ready to help the students. The teaching methodology is simple, slides are shown in the classroom and taught. Physical knowledge is little. Especially at the time of COVID, there was no teaching done as per se mostly because BITS follows a zero percent attendance system. Examinations depend on the course instructor and are easy to pass.
