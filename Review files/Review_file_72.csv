Easha Azad,Indraprastha College for Women - [IP],"B.A {Hons.}, Multi Media and Mass Communication",5.5,"BMMMC,IPCW Detailed Honest Review","I took this course because I didn't want to pursue BA in some heavily theoretical subject like political science or history.

The thing about BMMMC is that it tries to cover many different subjects from completely different fields in each semester. 
Its downside is that you just get to touh the surface of each subject but never get to master it enough to make use of it. 
You will have papers like Development communication, Communication Research, Anchoring for news and radio, EVS, theatre, photography, Graphic Designing, Introduction to Journalism etc.


The faculty isn't very qualified. They often hire ex students as teachers. 

Wouldn't name anyone but one lecturer in particular is very rude and sadistic, and she will be teaching you and over through the semesters. Though other lectures are nice and polite.
