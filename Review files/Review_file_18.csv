Sarthak Khaiwal,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",7.8,Should you consider LPU as a perfect college for you ?,"College life entirely depends on what you do with your life in college. LPU will give you all you want for a successful career and the skills thereof. But won't give you enough time to waste on non-productive and unnecessary things. You get tons of organizations to join, and a large number of events to participate in, organist, and enjoy. A large number of leisurely places, be it the central vista, Mall or playgrounds or gyms or swimming pools or indoor stadiums or skating rinks, or nets to practice. But it does not compromise in any case with your safety, your studies, your skill attainment, your employability, and finally your placements. Whatever the duration of your program, your campus life will depend on what YOU do with it. If you are sincere about your studies or any other activity, it will be great. The university charges a fee from your parents to enable a great career for you, and that's what LPU does best.",
