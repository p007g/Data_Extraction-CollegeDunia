As I grew old this interest only increased, so it was only natural to pursue MBA. IIMs are known for their quality of education, they offer world-class management education programs with a focus on rigorous academic coursework, case studies, and experiential learning. IIM Sirmaur is no exception.
The faculty at IIM Sirmaur are experts in their respective fields and have extensive industry experience. The teaching style is more focused on an application-based approach. The professors always keep us in a tricky situation, forcing us to think out of the box and solve the problem in front of us.
The weightage of end-term exams is not more than 40%, the rest is for projects, presentations, class participation, etc. As the weightage is distributed throughout the term, we are required to focus on all and not just end-term exams",
