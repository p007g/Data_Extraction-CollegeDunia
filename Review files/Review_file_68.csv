Karapureddi venkata krishna,Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology & Sciences - [ANITS],"B.Tech, Electrical And Electronics Engineering",8.7,One of the best college hope i give my best and I take best from it.,"I choose this course much interested in the subjects it involves. Another reason is we have the flexibility for preparing for many government and competitive exams in addition to the software knowledge too.
There were above 10 faculty members working for a single section in the branch. The ratio is 6:1 student and teacher ratio.
All the faculty members are abundantly knowledgeable. Their qualification is MTech in NITs and PHDs in well-known universities. The faculty will be quite strict in the punctuality and behavior criteria of students while coming to subjects they are much experienced in teaching you in the way you understand. Students can undoubtedly be free with faculty regarding studies and other constructive ideas.
There will be two semesters per year each semester will be 6months and every 60days days you will be having a mid examination. It is quite easy to pass if you concentrate on classes daily and continuous assessment in the subject. The notes provided by the teachers are enough for good scoring",

Gourav Bhati,Sri Venkateswara College - Delhi,"BA {Hons.}, Political Science",7.6,SVC from a student's view,"The course curriculum is also very decently managed but it has rigidity in opting for courses from different streams which would by itself get changes with implementation of NEP. 
Also, the education system in itself needs a reform with less importance to rote learning as with ICT revolution in hands of almost everyone, the traditional notion of parameter of judging people's intellect on basis of remembering something which might never help someone is counterproductive. 
According to the requisites of questions I opted for this course because I am a UPSC aspirant and this course in my opinion will help me in this Exam. 
Student teacher ratio in my own class is very poor reaching a staggering 1:127. 
Teachers are well qualified but this doesn't automatically make them well equipped with the delivery of their own knowledge. They still rely on age old techniques of teaching.
