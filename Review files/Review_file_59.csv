The teachers are also available there for you if you have some queries related to the subject or project etc. at last teachers are supportive of good students.
The university conducts various exams during semesters, first, they conduct 3 exams i.e. named CAT (1,2&3) as sub-exams for parts of the syllabus, and then a bind up the exam of all syllabus i.e. called E.T.E  and it is not that much difficult to maintain an 8+ C.G.P.A by studying a bit regularly and keeping concentration in class.",
