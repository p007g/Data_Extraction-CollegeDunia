Nirant Dekate,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",9.3,Honest VIT Vellore Review,"My Father is an Engineer. I watched him work with electronic devices since my childhood. It sparked some interest in me too. I never felt connected with any other stream.
Faculty to Student Ratio - I don't exactly know but I guess its somewhat 1:50 which is considered pretty bad but I never felt a lack of attention or guidance from the faculties
Most of the Faculties are Doctorate Holders
And even the Lab assistants are Doctorate Aspirants. All Teacher's Notes are provided on their Official Student Site VTOP.
Teaching methods vary from teacher to teacher but most of the times its good.
There are 3 exams - CAT 1, CAT 2 and FAT.
There is an exam after every 5-6 weeks of classes.
CAT 2 is open book
Other Exams are Close Book
None of the exams are very tough to pass.
But we need to understand that passing is never an issue. Main aim should be getting good grades. Getting S Grade is quite tough.",

Abhinav Krishnan E,Jawaharlal College of Engineering and Technology - [JCET] Ottapalam,"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",6.2,All about JCET,From the 6th semester onwards the students become eligible for placement. But to participate in the placement programs you have to pass all the examinations conducted by the university. There are so many companies coming to the college for placement like TCS Infosys Adobe Wipro etc. If you are taking computer science and engineering and you have no backpacks then you can easily place them at the college. I don't know correctly about the salary package I think that the average salary package is 5lakh/annum. To get a job after completing this degree you have to learn a skill based on software development. Then you can get a job easily after completing the course. I am studying android development and I want to become an app developer after completing this degree.,
