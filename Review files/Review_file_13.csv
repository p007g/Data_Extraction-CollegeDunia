Chhavi Pathania,IILM University,"B.Tech, Biotechnology",8.0,"IILM UNIVERSITY, Greater Noida - A step closer to your dream","I loved the craftsmanship of a biotechnologist, so I too wanted to go into research and development programs hence I opted for Btech biotechnology at IILM University. It's the best place to gain knowledge and make yourself future-ready with great exposure. 
There are a good lot of biotechnology faculties who are highly experienced and highly qualified, almost all of them are Ph.D. holders with great knowledge, provide great guidance, and are student-friendly. They make the subject interesting with crystal clear topics which are easy to learn and grasp since they use many different practices to make learning interesting. 
Since I am AKTU affiliated I have to give 2 sessional exams each in a month and then end-semester exams. Those who are directly from the university have to give one mid-semester exam and then one final semester exam. Exams are good enough since they cover each topic/unit of equal weight. So if you have studied well u can score good marks and get an excellent ranking.",
