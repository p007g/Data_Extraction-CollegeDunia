RAHUL GOYAL,IIM Sirmaur,"MBA, General",9.3,An IIM to be in,"In my point of view course curriculum is inclined to the industry needs.IIM Sirmaur has 35+ in-house faculty and 600+ students. The faculty-to-student ratio is similar to all the new generation iims. In the coming year, after the setup of its own institute campus, IIM Sirmaur will match the faculty-student ratio with the top IIMs.The faculty is highly qualified with PhD from IITs, IIMs, and other renowned universities worldwide. The teaching pedagogy is case-based, where theoretical learning is developed with practical case situations.IIM Sirmaur also houses some visiting faculty for particular courses, which provide us with wider learning.IIM Sirmaur has six terms in 2 years with every term consisting of a mid-term and an end-term with assignments, quizzes, and presentations. Every portion has its own weight and due to relative grading, it's quite challenging to score in an exam.",
