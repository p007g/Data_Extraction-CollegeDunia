Some of the faculty members like Dr. Avinash are so good, they have very deep knowledge about their subjects.
I chose this course because I have an interest in electronics. The faculty: student ratio might be somewhere around 1:45. Most of the faculty members have done Ph.D., so they are experienced but the teaching method is not that good because most of the teachers play presentation during a lecture and they just repeat what is written in that presentation rather than explaining. But some faculty members like Dr. Avinash are so good at teaching, he always makes the lecture interesting and has an old fashion of teaching with chalk. The exams were of medium difficulty if you have the basic knowledge you can pass exams. The mid-term exams start after 6 weeks and end the term after 12 weeks.",

Shubham Kumar,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering",8.7,SRM Institute of Science and Technology,"My course is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering). 
I chose this course because of my interest in the subject, as well as the excellent placement my college offers in this department. 
The faculty: student ratio is close to 1:3, which is a good number. 
Most of the faculties I have came across till now are PhD holders. 
The teaching method used by most of the faculties is by using pre-made presentations by the college faculties. They use it to lead the course systematically, while also using the conventional, explanation on the blackboard. They give questions and also try to explain the practical implementation of the topics. 
The exams are properly placed throughout the semester to give enough time for the students to prepare for the next exams or do any other co-curricular activities they might be interested in. 
We have 3 cycle tests, and finally semester exams every semester. 
The difficulty of the exams is moderate. Just give enough time to every subject.",

Plus in EC campus the hostel for 1st years is at a different location away from the college. The hostel inside the college is only for 2nd,3rd and 4th years, so the hostel synergy is low for first year. Most of the sports are available including many like badminton, basketball, etc. With the new MRD sports centre opening up hopefully it will get better. For now the only 2 badminton coursts they have are outdoor and since Bangalore weather is always windy, it is difficult to play.
The library has most of the books required but it's better to get the course books early since other people also want them.
