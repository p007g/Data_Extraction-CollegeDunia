Vamsj,Ramaiah Institute of Technology - [RIT],"BE, Computer Science And Engineering",8.0,Detailed review of MSRIT,I have chosen this course because it is having more demand and better opportunities for a further carrier. The student and faculty ratio is 1:50 and the faculty are well qualified like at least had completed their masters and research in their domain. The sem exam is once in 6 months and they are moderate to pass.,
