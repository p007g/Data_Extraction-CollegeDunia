Keshav,Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",,All about NITJ,"NIT works on an internal system. So course curriculum changes and is always kept best keeping in mind the requirements of the industry but I will say if you are thinking this curriculum will give you more practical knowledge then it's not.  All studies will be done in the old traditional form as we used to do since our childhood. Faculty members are good, and well educated in their field. But you will get some faculty members who are too bad at explaining concepts. That is a scenario in every college that you will not get everything best.",5.8/10
