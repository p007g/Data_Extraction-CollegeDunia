Also, the science and arithmetic departments don't show much interest in helping to urge their students placed. However, that's not the case if you join another course.

Ramesh,NRI Institute of Technology - [NRIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",8.0,NRIIT- Review,"Hands-on job experience.

The best way to learn is by doing. An internship provides the opportunity to not just apply classroom learning to the real world, but gain practical skills as well.

Meaningful connections.

Many jobs are obtained through connections. Internships provide networking opportunities and ways to meet people who can serve as mentors.

An opportunity to “test drive” a career.

Ideally, an internship will provide a taste of a particular job, which can help a student decide if that’s the right career path for them. If not, there’s often still plenty of time to make changes.

Excellent resume boost.

A great internship helps any resume, especially if it provides a student with hands-on experience in their field. It also serves as proof to employers that a graduate is serious about their chosen profession.

Help society.

Many students take internships with non-profits and other charitable organizations that provide beneficial services for a local community or society.",
