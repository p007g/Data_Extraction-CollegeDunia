I basically choose this field because it is a chance to serve the man me. And it is the better pathway to earn the money. The faculty and students ratio is enough. There is a limited seats in every medical college. But currently, there is an increasing trend of medical colleges in our state that will do bad conditions for the future. The qualification of the faculty is very excellent. They are high degree holders in their field. The teaching method depends on the teacher.

and if you prepare by yourself I mean you have to prepare yourself for placements if you want a good placement. If you rely on college for everything then you will get disappointed, you will get placed but not on a higher package. There are so many companies that are big MNCs like TCS, Capgemini, etc are gonna come and recruit so many students so you don't have to worry about your job if you have at least an average score in all of your semesters. To sit in the placements you have to maintain a 7.5 cgpa every semester. The college supports you if have an idea and you want to do any startups you can take guidance from the faculty and seniors.

Most of the teachers had qualifications as Master of their subjects.
Tech qualified. Only a few of the teachers were Ph.D. qualified. The teaching method of the First & second-year faculties was very good.

Student (Anonymous),Zakir Husain College,"BA, Political Science",,Delhi University: Best or Hype,"I have chosen Political Science(Hons.) for my graduation, Political Science was the subject which I have always liked.
