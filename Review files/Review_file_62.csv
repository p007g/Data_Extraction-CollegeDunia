Mehak Sisodia,IILM University,"B.Des, Fashion Design",9.2,A University for great learning and opportunities,I chose the course here because the kind of diverse learning and opportunities you could get here is good speaking in terms of productivity.  One or sometimes two teachers teach the class size of 25-30 students so the students don't feel left out and everyone gets ample time to get their doubts cleared. the faculty's teaching method is quite good as they challenge you with new and different activities daily based on new trends or what is needed or relevant for the course. They ask you to push yourself to think outside the box.  every two-three months there's a term exam that you have to clear and the level of difficulty is good to check whether the students are understanding the subject that is being taught in the class.,

No discrimination on the basis of religion and caste whatsoever, this is a very great trait at a college.

Mehul,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - [IIITD],"B.Tech, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence",9.2,IIIT Delhi Insider review,"The course curriculum is pretty modern. Unlike major colleges in India like IITs, NITs, etc., students are not required to study physics, chemistry, or math courses in their freshman year. All major and upcoming tech domains have courses that the students can take as electives as and when they want. There are no attendance criteria for 97% of courses. The student-faculty ratio is course dependent for example for a core course for my branch the ratio may be as low as 20 students per teacher and the ratio for a common course may be as high as 100 students for a teacher. However, all the professors and TAs have a lot of office hours in which the students can go and clear doubts. The dates of the exams are fixed for a semester and the difficulty depends on the course. In addition to exams, most courses also have assignments and project work. The date of submission for these is variable though and may even be extended if many students face difficulties in them.",
