And about the college crowd, it was good because you find a lot of students in every DU college and the faculty is the best and have lots of experience in the teaching line. Every lecturer at DU has completed Phd. and has higher degrees. They give you practical knowledge rather than totally depending on theories.

If you will start your studies before a month of exams then you easily pass the exam.",

Each semester you will have 3 core subjects of 3 credit courses along with languages and an open elective for the first 3 semesters so in total 6 subjects each semester. The faculty to students rating is kind of balanced but I feel that faculty members are still adapting to changes as per NEP therefore they require more training to teach students and make classes interactive .suddenly teachers will leave the college in middle due to some issues and the majority of the classes are boring. Though all the professors and teachers here have a master's or a Ph.D. qualification they still find it difficult to adapt to new methods of teaching and rely on the same old boring lecture system. As for the teaching methods we don't have any textbooks but rely on online LMS.,
