Student (Anonymous),Purulia Polytechnic,"Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering",8.0,PURULIA POLYTECHNIC  COLLEGE REVIEW,"I think at a polytechnic level, presuming that your internship will most likely be related to your field of study, then it doesn't matter where you intern but what you can get out of the company in terms of knowledge, and depending on your goal.
For eg if you plan to be an entrepreneur, and you go to an innovative company, you can learn about the new and interesting methods that other companies have yet to adopt, which gives you an edge. If it is to a traditional firm, then find out where you can value add to improve the processes. In the past, it might not be easy to change old ways of doing things but you have the adVantage of technology today. I think this is a good place to start because many companies in SG are in need of an overhaul",

However, aanyone familiar with the law school sceneries will be able to tell you that some very important thing have been overlooked.
I didnt got any scholarships from government but I got scholarships from college. That is very beneficial for me at that time.

After finding out that NSUT has the best ECE as it's the oldest branch there, I decided on NSUT ECE.

The class size here is about 60 which isn't too bad. The teachers are well qualified but knowing something and being able to teach it are two different things. Similar to almost everywhere else, there are a few excellent teachers and a few not-so-great teachers who only read PDFs in classes. As I have only taken online classes, I can't be sure about their teaching proficiency offline.

For 1st semester, after a short 3-month online semester with 1 viva, 1 long, and 3 short tests, we were supposed to give offline end semester exams. 1st sem results aren't out yet but a few teachers have told us that quite a lot of students have been failed.
