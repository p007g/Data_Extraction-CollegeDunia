Harsh,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"B.Tech, Electronics & Communication Engineering",7.5,Partially Satisfied with my college.,"There are not many Fests, because right now we don't have our own campus. And the no. of students are also very less. So yaa, you will not get to enjoy the college life as you want. But I think we were the last lucky batch, as we get to attend the facilities and fests of SVNIT. 
LIbrary - For now we are using the same library of SVNIT, but I don't know what will happen now. 
 IN 2019 it was the first time our college team has participated in intra IIIT competetion and after that covid Happen. But I think it will continue in future. 
There are several clubs like Dance , photography , Singing etc.. 
But don't expect much from these groups. As the no. of students are very less as compared to other colleges. 
And this was the same case with almost all the IIITs because of only 2 branches and less students. 

And if you want to much about the college and campus life you can see my vlogs .
