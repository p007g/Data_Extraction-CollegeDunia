Some goals are in conflict with other goals: ""I'd like to be working in a job where I am paid a lot of money, but don't do a lot of work.""
 

Lack of ability may be perceived or real: ""I've never done that kind of work before, there is no way I'll be successful.""
 

Perceived inability may be linked to feelings of personal worth: ""If I don't choose the right major, I'll be a disappointment and a failure.""
