It is a place where one learns to observe the world, not from any particular point of view or conclusion. One learns to look at the whole of man\u2019s endeavour, his search for beauty, his search for truth and for a way of living without conflict. Conflict is the very essence of violence. So far education has not been concerned with this, but in this school our intent is to understand actuality and its action without any preconceived ideals, theories, or beliefs which bring about a contradictory attitude towards existence. The school is concerned with freedom and order. Freedom is not the expression of one\u2019s own desire, choice or self-interest. That inevitably leads to disorder. Freedom of choice is not freedom, though it may appear so; nor is order conformity or imitation. Order can only come with the insight that to choose is itself the denial of freedom.\"","Institute_Info":{"Institute Type":"Coaching","Official Website":"http:\/\/www.gracetech.co.in"},"Courses_Details":[{"Course Name":"Online Learning Program: IT Courses Programming Session","Course Fees":"\u20b9 5,999","Course Time":"3 Months","Program Type":"Online Learning Programs"},{"Course Name":"Regular Classroom Program: Electronics Courses Programming Session","Course Fees":"\u20b9 5,999","Course Time":"3 Months","Program Type":"Regular Classroom Programs"},{"Course Name":"Regular Classroom Program: Civil Courses Sessions","Course Fees":"\u20b9 5,999","Course Time":"3 Months","Program Type":"Regular Classroom Programs"}]},{"Institute_Name":"Kumar Physics Classes","Institute_Centres":"Pune","Institute_Logo":"https:\/\/images.collegedunia.com\/public\/image\/institute\/logo_1618679214logo.JPG?h=75&w=75&mode=stretch","Institute_Place":"New Delhi, Delhi NCR,","Institute_Rating":7.8,"Institute_Summary":"Self-teaching by Mr. Kumar (ex fiitjee) \/ (ex Aakash) faculty best physics home tuition\/group classes for physics in south Delhi for class xi, xii, IIT, neet,ib hl\/SL, sat 2 physics target 100% Kumar sir is known for his command of physics for neet medical, IIT engineering & all board exams like CBSE, ICSE, up the board, ib sat physics, ap physics.
